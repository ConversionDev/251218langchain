Foreword 
The OECD Employment Outlook provides an annual assessment of key labour market developments and 
prospects in OECD member countries. Each edition also includes several chapters that focus on specific 
aspects of the functioning of labour markets and the implications for policies to promote more and better 
jobs. The 2025 edition of the OECD Employment Outlook examines the challenges that population ageing 
poses to current living standards, labour markets, and social cohesion more generally. The consequences 
of an ageing workforce for productivity growth are also investigated. Policies to address these demographic 
changes are analysed. The first chapter assesses recent labour market and wage developments. 
The OECD Employment Outlook 2025 is the joint work of staff of the Directorate for Employment, Labour 
and Social Affairs (ELS). The Outlook has also greatly benefitted from comments from other OECD 
Directorates and contributions from national government delegates and national institutions. However, the 
Outlook’s assessment of the labour market prospects for each country does not necessarily correspond to 
those made by the national authorities and institutions concerned.

Editorial: From job shortage to 
labour shortage: The new 
challenge of population ageing 
We are living in uncertain times. The rapid advances in generative AI – a key driver of the accelerating 
digital revolution – are fuelling both optimism and concern. On the one hand, there is hope for renewed 
productivity growth, job creation, and more inclusive labour markets. On the other, there is fear of job 
displacement and widening inequalities, as algorithms increasingly take over not only routine tasks but 
also complex and rewarding ones. Meanwhile, the urgently needed transition to a more sustainable 
economy continues to move forward in fits and starts. As if these structural transformations were not 
challenging enough, the short-term economic outlook is becoming increasingly fragile. Rising trade barriers 
and tighter financial conditions are undermining both business investment and consumer confidence, 
dragging down growth. 
In this complex and volatile environment, one encouraging certainty stands out: people around the world 
are living longer and healthier lives than ever before. This remarkable achievement has been accompanied 
by declining fertility, leading to significant demographic shifts and shaping a new era. While there are 
exciting opportunities to rethink work, retirement, and longevity, the challenges for the labour market and 
the broader economy are substantial and cannot be ignored. 
The year 2025 has been pencilled in the demographers’ calendar for a long time. Indeed, the mid of the 
decade has been often cited as the turning point when the working age population (traditionally defined as 
20 to 64 years old) would have stopped growing in the OECD and then started to decline. 
And so it has. Fertility has been on a downward trend over the past decades, and it is now well below 
replacement levels in almost all OECD countries. As baby-boomers exit the labour market, the working-
age population in OECD countries is now starting to decrease, and is projected to continue to fall through 
to 2060. Though this is not the case in every country, the potential workforce will shrink not only in most of 
Europe but also in many Asian economies like Japan and Korea. 
Meanwhile, the old-age dependency ratio – defined as the ratio of individuals aged 65 years and above to 
the working-age population – has soared and will continue to grow in the future. According to the United 
Nations’ medium projections, the OECD old-age dependency ratio will be 52% in 2060, almost three times 
as large as in 1980. In some countries, it will rise above 70%. In practice, this means that, in the average 
OECD country, each person of working age would have to sustain herself and provide for 50% of the 
income of an older person on retirement, and even more than 70% in some countries. 
The impact of ageing populations threatens the very engine of economic growth, which depends on human 
resources to produce output. The economy of OECD countries has entered a new era, where the challenge 
shifts from a shortage of jobs to a shortage of workers.

Exactly how this new kind of global economy will play out is not clear. It’s an unsettling time with seemingly 
contradictory indicators. According to evidence presented in this Outlook, as the number of working age 
people stagnates in the OECD, jobs are now going unfilled even as people are losing work and wages 
barely keep up with inflation. In the euro area, for example, one in six firms in industry and one in four firms 
in services cited lack of labour as one of the factors limiting production in April 2025. While these figures 
are well below the post-pandemic peaks (about one in four in industry and one in three in services), they 
are above the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, despite a deteriorating conjunctural phase. The persistence of 
labour shortages despite the slowdown in growth may be a disorienting preview of times to come. 
Alongside the much-discussed transformational topics of climate change and digital revolution, the ageing 
of OECD economies is the third, and what we might call “forgotten,” megatrend that requires the full 
attention of policy makers. 
According to simulations presented in this Outlook, at current rates of productivity growth, GDP per capita 
growth is expected to slow down by about 40% in the OECD area – from the already meagre 1% per year 
in 2006-19 to 0.6% per year in 2024-60 on average. All but two OECD countries, Ireland and the 
United States, would see their per-capita growth declining if nothing is done. 
There is no time for complacency, or easy answers. Some brush off the demographic challenge as 
something that will be solved by the boost of artificial intelligence, a kind of fortuitous historical coincidence 
that will see bots stepping in for the declining human workforce. While AI can improve productivity, it is by 
no means a substitute or silver bullet for a lack of human workers. Degrowth or lower growth may have 
some advantages (including facilitating the fight against climate change), but it is not compatible with the 
rising needs of an ageing population. When it is not the result of a broadly shared societal consensus, 
lower growth risks jeopardising social and economic sustainability. Historically, growth deceleration since 
the 1970s has indeed gone hand in hand with an upward trend in social discontent. Put simply, 
governments cannot continue to ignore this shift, which will only accelerate. 
Instead, hard and smart policy choices are required. The good news is that there are concrete steps our 
societies can take. OECD countries enjoy several untapped talent pools that they can turn to boost their 
labour forces: youth, migrants, women and older workers. Some of the changes required can trigger thorny 
societal and political issues and finding the right policies to mobilise these resources may not be easy. Yet 
the barriers to employment for these workers must be removed, and governments must take bold actions 
to do so. 
This mobilisation would have not only economic but also social advantages, largely counterbalancing the 
projected fall in GDP per capita growth as well as addressing intergenerational disparities and labour 
market barriers. Indeed, these policies include empowering young people, taking a proactive approach to 
regular labour migration, closing the gender employment gap and encouraging healthy older workers to 
work as long as they can and desire. While the right mix of policies and solutions will differ among 
OECD countries, for more than half, mobilising older workers is key. And across the OECD, mobilising all 
resources is essential to continuing to grow and improving living standards. 
Mobilising young people, women and migrants 
Young people have borne the brunt of current intergenerational disparities and face potential competition 
with AI for entry level jobs. Yet mobilising young people aged 15 to 29 years is particularly crucial in some 
OECD countries. In nine of them (Colombia, Costa Rica, Greece, Italy, Korea, Lithuania, Mexico, Spain and 
Türkiye), more than 15% of youth are in the category of “not in employment, education or training” (NEET), 
representing a major waste of potential talent. Reducing NEET rates and boosting youth employment with 
policies that aim to improve education services, reduce school dropouts, offer full-time, second-chance 
educational programmes and encourage school-to-work transitions are more than ever key.

In all OECD countries, progress has been made in promoting employment opportunities for women. Yet, 
differences persist not only in the level but also in the quality of jobs. Compared to men, women are often 
paid significantly less, work fewer paid hours and take on more unpaid work, such as family and caring 
responsibilities. Closing the gender employment gap could increase annual GDP per capita growth by 
0.2 percentage points across the OECD – half of the decline projected in the baseline scenario. Closing 
the gender gap in hours worked could double that figure. To mobilise the female workforce, governments 
must promote gender equality not only in the labour market but also in unpaid work and the domestic 
workload. These policies include guaranteeing equal pay; facilitating women’s access to science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics studies and encouraging their success in entrepreneurship and 
decision-making positions; promoting gender- and family-friendly policies within firms; expanding access 
to quality affordable childcare and elderly care. 
Regular migrants are already helping to sustain working-age populations across the OECD and play key 
roles in reducing labour shortages in certain sectors. The foreign-born are also over-represented among 
the self-employed, and migrant entrepreneurs significantly contribute to job creation in host countries. 
While migrants are expected to continue to do so in the future, to be a game changer, net migration rates 
must surpass historic values. By increasing migration flows to the level observed in the top quarter of most 
open countries in the past 4 years, the median OECD country could improve its GDP per capita growth by 
0.08 percentage points with respect to the baseline scenario. Regular pathways that respond to labour 
market needs paired with international co-operation are essential to a well-functioning migration 
management system. But ensuring adequate access of migrants to housing, education, transport and other 
public services should also be an integral part of a well-managed migration strategy. 
Empowering older workers 
Older workers may be the hidden key to this labour shortage, both to its root cause and its possible 
solutions. People are living longer, staying in better health for longer and are able to work longer. In the 
OECD, life expectancy at birth has now surpassed 80 years, and more than 70% of the increase in life 
expectancy at age 60 since 2000 is in good health. This is a great achievement. At the same time, it also 
means that many old-age people are well-placed to continue to make a positive contribution to economic 
growth and shared prosperity. Yet, while employment of older workers has significantly increased for 
workers below 60 years of age, significant progress is needed in many countries for older age categories. 
Encouraging and facilitating healthy older workers to remain in the labour market longer is key to boosting 
the workforce as well as reducing the burden of younger generations. On the one hand, by reducing the 
retirement rate of older people to that of the 10% of OECD countries with the lowest rates, about half of 
the OECD countries could gain at least 0.2 percentage points of annual GDP per capita growth, a figure 
that would increase by another 0.1 percentage point if the gender gap among older workers were 
simultaneously closed. On the other hand, relying only on younger people to enhance growth would raise 
equity issues, since income and wealth disparities have evolved in favour of older people in recent years 
in many countries. 
Crucially, however, governments must look beyond pension reform – which has dominated such debates 
in many countries – and ensure that older workers have the skills, health, support and opportunities to 
remain meaningfully employed. Employers and policy makers alike have a role to play in fostering a labour 
market that values older workers as a vital asset. They must focus on confronting ageism, creating 
age-friendly workplaces, promoting lifelong learning and employability throughout the life course, and 
supporting positive job mobility. Policy action should focus also on mid-career workers, since career 
trajectories in one’s 50s are key determinants of employment patterns in one’s 60s.

Keeping an eye on AI 
Reviving productivity growth must also be part of the solution. Many researchers and policy makers are 
optimistic about AI’s potential for reviving productivity growth. But the benefits of AI may not be shared 
equally, and much depends on how AI is used. 
AI could, for example, help extend working lives by alleviating physical work, improving mental health and 
making work safer and working conditions more adaptable to the needs of older workers, all factors that 
are key to make people stay in employment as they age. Most workers in our review of the impact of AI in 
the workplace agreed that AI improves not only their performance but also their enjoyment of work as well 
as their mental and physical health. The promise of AI to help people with disabilities overcome labour 
market barriers has already been demonstrated – including by providing workarounds to people with 
disability (such as live captioning for deaf individuals), or that address disabilities directly (such as AI-
powered prosthetics) or making work content and workplaces more accessible. Such tools likely will be of 
help for age-related disability as well. AI could further benefit older workers by being used to address some 
of health’s largest challenges, including: a depleted workforce, future threats to public health, ageing 
populations, and increasing complexity of health due to multiple chronic conditions. 
Pulling out all the stops 
The uncertainties of AI – as well as climate change, geopolitical tensions and economic instability – come 
as governments face enormous pressure over public debt and spending, particularly on programmes that 
are not social in nature. As ageing-related labour shortage takes hold, governments will have more limited 
resources and less room to manoeuvre to face global uncertainties and to maintain living standards. 
Maintaining economic growth is therefore essential. The scenario of a person of working age sustaining 
herself and providing for 50% to 70% of the income of an older person would not be sustainable. 
Profound demographic changes are making a significant slowdown in living standards growth a tangible 
risk – but not an inevitable one. Preventing this outcome will require a comprehensive strategy that 
harnesses untapped potential in the labour market, particularly by increasing the participation of under-
represented groups and supporting the employment and employability of older workers. At the same time, 
it will be essential to promote the trustworthy use of AI and digital technologies to drive productivity gains. 
Crucially, this strategy must also be fair – ensuring that no one is left behind and that the costs and benefits 
of transition are shared equitably. 
When faced with a turning point as stark as the current demographic shift, OECD countries have no choice 
but to act.

Executive summary 
Labour markets remain resilient but there are early signs of slowdown 
OECD labour markets have continued to show resilience over the past year. Employment and labour force 
participation have reached record highs, while unemployment remains historically low. However, there are 
signs of weakening labour markets, with employment growth decelerating and labour market tightness in 
many countries and sectors falling back to pre-COVID-19 levels, although labour shortages remain. 
Looking ahead, geopolitical uncertainties and hikes in tariff rates are expected to dampen economic 
activity, leading to further labour market slowdowns. 
Real wages are growing in virtually all OECD countries, but there is still room for 
catching-up in many of them 
Real wages are now growing virtually everywhere in the OECD, but their levels remain below the levels 
seen in early 2021 – just before the post-pandemic inflation surge – in half of OECD countries. The wages 
of the lowest-paid workers have held up particularly well, as the real statutory minimum wage has increased 
since then in virtually all the 30 OECD countries with a national minimum wage. As real wages continue to 
recover, unit profits continue to lose the ground gained since 2021. In the near future, however, the wage 
recovery could be jeopardised by the potential comeback of high inflation and labour market slowdown. 
Without decisive policy action, the demographic transition will dampen GDP per 
capita growth in the medium term 
Declining fertility and increasing life expectancy imply that the OECD population is becoming older. With 
the progressive exit of baby boomers from the labour force, OECD countries’ working-age population 
(aged 20 to 64 years) is declining while their old-age dependency ratio – defined as the ratio of individuals 
aged 65 years and above to the working-age population – has increased dramatically from 19% in 1980 to 
31% in 2023 and is projected to rise further to 52% by 2060. In turn, without further policy action or changes 
in behaviours, this will weigh significantly on economic growth and the capacity of OECD countries to 
continue improving their living standards. Without a significant acceleration of productivity growth, GDP 
per capita growth would slow down by about 40% in the OECD area (from 1% per year in 2006-19 to 0.6% 
per year in 2024-60 on average). All but two OECD countries would see their per-capita growth declining. 
Mobilising untapped labour resources will be key to offset this downfall 
The downfall in GDP per capita growth, however, could be largely counterbalanced by the mobilisation of 
significantly untapped labour resources, especially among women, older people in good health and regular 
migrants. Additionally, the dynamic of intergenerational disparities – that is, the shift of income and wealth

OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
toward older cohorts and poverty concentrating more among young ones – suggests that mobilising old-
age people in good health would be necessary not only for efficiency reasons but also for fairness reasons. 
Labour market policies and employer practices must evolve to support an ageing 
workforce 
Despite progress in past decades, employment rates start to decline from age 50 and drop sharply after 
60. Continued reforms of pension systems remain important to delay labour market exit, including carefully 
designed flexible retirement options that allow for the combination of pension and labour income. However, 
greater focus should be placed on the employability of older workers in a rapidly changing world of work. 
Policies should support the demand for older workers among employers. Indeed, rising employment rates 
of older workers create opportunities for employers to retain valuable knowledge and skills and boost 
productivity. However, employers often hesitate to hire or retain older workers due to age stereotypes 
around adaptability, productivity, or the need for workplace accommodations. Policies should also help 
older workers maintain and adapt their skills and capabilities and facilitate job mobility. Enhancing 
employability and career progression throughout a person’s working life is crucial for improving job 
prospects later in life. Some older workers also face skill challenges or poor health that prevent them from 
participating fully in the labour market. Supportive measures – such as lifelong learning, flexible work, and 
healthy work environments – are vital. 
Lifelong investments in skills are necessary to allow older workers to thrive… 
As economies evolve, the nature of work changes too. There are fewer physically demanding jobs and 
more roles that reward experience offering workers greater opportunities to remain productive for longer. 
However, there is a risk that benefits from these developments are offset by a decline in skills as the 
workforce ages. For instance, adults aged 60-65 years have significantly lower literacy and adaptive 
problem-solving skills than those aged 25-29. While part of this gap reflects cohort differences in 
educational attainment, skill levels have also declined with age within each cohort over the past decade. 
To address this, supporting older workers in maintaining and adapting their skills is crucial. Yet, in 2023, 
only a third of adults aged 60-65 years participated in training, compared to over half of those aged 25-44. 
In this context, there is an urgent need to avoid skill declines and foster a culture of continuous learning, 
shifting to a career model where learning at work takes place throughout life. Stronger action to expand 
access to career guidance and lifelong learning should be considered, especially for mid-career and older 
workers. 
…and so are policies addressing barriers to job-to-job mobility 
Demographic change has resulted in declining job-to-job mobility, negatively affecting wage and 
productivity growth. In fact, unlike involuntary employment transitions, voluntary job-to-job mobility 
significantly contributes to wage and productivity growth by reallocating workers to better jobs in better 
firms. However, this process declines sharply with age as workers become less mobile and less likely to 
transition to higher-quality firms. As a result, demographic ageing has reduced wage and productivity 
annual growth rates by respectively 0.10 and 0.13 percentage points between 2000 and 2019. Policies 
must provide sufficient flexibility for firms while offering opportunities for job mobility to workers. For mid-
career and older workers in particular, targeted interventions including early support, wage insurance, job-
search assistance, and continuous skill development can help maintain job-to-job mobility.

In Brief 
OECD labour markets have continued to show resilience over the past year, but early signs of a 
slowdown are now visible, with more moderate employment growth and an easing of labour shortages. 
Nevertheless, real wages are rising year-on-year in virtually all OECD countries, although they remain 
below early 2021 levels in half of them. In the future, geopolitical uncertainties and tariff increases if 
confirmed are expected to dampen economic activity and may weigh on inflation and wages. 
The latest labour market data available at the time of writing suggest that: 
• 
OECD employment and labour force participation rates have reached record highs, while 
unemployment remains at historically low levels in many countries. The OECD 
unemployment rate remained at 4.9% in May 2025. The average employment rate in the OECD 
rose to 72.1% in Q1 2025, while the average participation rate reached 76.6%. 
• 
However, there are signs of worsening labour market conditions, as employment growth 
continues to decelerate. Employment rates rose by 0.12 percentage points on average in the 
OECD between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, compared with 0.20 between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. In 
the near future, geopolitical uncertainties and hikes in tariff rates are expected to dampen 
economic activity, leading to further labour market slowdowns. 
• 
Labour shortages continued to ease but labour markets remain tight. Labour market 
tightness has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in many OECD countries, as has the efficiency 
of matching between employers and jobseekers. Nonetheless, tightness remains remarkably 
above pre-crisis levels in several countries, and pre-COVID-19 labour markets were already 
tight for a number of structural reasons that are well at play. 
• 
Gender gaps in employment and labour force participation are narrowing in many 
OECD countries. Between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, on average across OECD countries, 
women’s employment rate rose by around 0.32 percentage points more than men’s, while the 
gender gap in the participation rate narrowed by 0.3 percentage points. 
• 
The incidence of part-time employment has remained stable. However, this masks 
substantial offsetting changes in voluntary and involuntary part-time. Involuntary part-time 
declined as labour markets recovered from the COVID-19 crisis and tightened. However, 
voluntary part-time increased simultaneously by about the same amounts, possibly because 
some workers switched from full-time to part-time as: (i) their preferences shifted from work to 
family commitments during the COVID-19 crisis; and (ii) employers became more willing to 
accommodate requests for part-time work as labour markets tightened. 
• 
Real wages are now growing in virtually all OECD countries but remain below the levels 
seen in early 2021 – just before the post-pandemic inflation surge – in half of them. 
According to the latest data for Q1 2025, annual real wage growth was positive in 33 of the 
37 OECD countries for which data are available, with an average across countries of 2.5%. 
However, real wages remained below their Q1 2021 level in 18 of these 37 countries. Looking 
ahead, the wage recovery could be jeopardised, as geopolitical uncertainties and hikes in tariff 
rates may significantly weaken labour markets while exerting further upward pressure on inflation. 
• 
The real statutory minimum wage was higher in April 2025 than in January 2021 in 
virtually all the 30 OECD countries with a statutory minimum wage. The increase in the 
average real minimum wage across these 30 countries was 7.9%, while that of the median real 
minimum wage, unaffected by particularly large increases in some countries, was 4.7%.

• 
The wages of the lowest-paid workers have proved more resilient than median wages to 
the post-pandemic inflation surge. Although empirical evidence remains scarce, a 
compression of the wage distribution at the bottom could be observed in some countries during 
the COVID-19 crisis and subsequent recovery. 
• 
As real wages continue to recover, unit profits continue to lose the ground gained during 
the post-pandemic inflation surge. Unit labour costs increased more than unit profits between 
Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 in most OECD countries, continuing a trend that began around Q1 2023. 
This reflects the catching-up of purchasing power by wages after the disproportionate 
contribution of unit profits to the inflation surge in 2021-22; and should not be seen as a warning 
sign of price-wage spirals.  
Introduction 
OECD labour markets suffered major shocks in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis and Russia’s war of 
aggression against Ukraine. Fluctuations in labour demand and the efficiency of the matching process 
between labour demand and supply led to labour shortages in many sectors of the economy (OECD, 
2024[1]; OECD, 2022[2]). A sharp rise in prices caused real wages to decline and living standards to fall, 
while most central banks tightened monetary policies. Nonetheless, OECD labour markets proved resilient 
to the negative consequences of these shocks (OECD, 2024[3]; Araki et al., 2023[4]). This chapter presents 
the latest labour market and wage developments across the OECD. In particular, it takes stock of labour 
shortages, with a particular focus on their potential lasting effects on part-time employment patterns. It also 
examines the latest impacts of the cost-of-living crisis on wages, as well as the risks associated with 
geopolitical uncertainties and rising tariff rates. 
The chapter is organised as follows: Section 1.1 reviews recent labour market developments in 
OECD countries; Section 1.2 reports on labour shortages and their possible impact on part-time 
employment patterns; and Section 1.3 reports on recent wage developments, including an update on 
statutory minimum wages and negotiated wages. Section 1.4 concludes. 
1.1. Labour markets have been supported by resilient economic growth but there 
are early signs of slowdown 
GDP growth in OECD countries slowed down in Q1 2025 after several years of resilient pace (Figure 1.1). 
All along 2024 in most major economies, disinflation and the resulting easing of monetary policy helped to 
offset the uncertainty created by geopolitical tensions and persistent concerns over the cost of living, 
especially in the United States (OECD, 2024[1]). In early 2025, however, economic growth turned negative 
in a number of OECD countries including, Japan, Korea, the United States and a number of euro area 
countries (e.g. Denmark, Norway, Portugal and Slovenia) (OECD, 2025[5]). Still, growth remained solid in 
other euro area countries, including Germany, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom.

1.1.1. Labour markets have remained resilient 
Unemployment remains historically low 
Unemployment rates remain at historically low levels in many OECD countries but have stopped their 
declining trends (Figure 1.2). While the OECD unemployment rate was already at its pre-COVID-19 level 
in Q1 2022, it continued to decline, reaching a record low of 4.8% in Q2 2023 (OECD, 2024[3]). It has then 
remained stable over the past two years to stand at 4.9% in Q1 2025. That same quarter, the 
unemployment rate was 0.5 percentage points or more above its Q1 2024 level in only around a quarter 
of OECD countries: Austria, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Luxembourg, New Zealand, 
Slovenia and Sweden. On the other hand, Costa Rica stands out for the magnitude of its recent 
unemployment rate reduction: from 10.5% in Q1 2023 to 7.4% in Q1 2025. Monthly data suggests that the 
OECD unemployment rate was at 4.9% in May 2025.

Employment continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace 
Employment rates continued to grow in most OECD countries in 2024, reaching new records, even though 
in many countries growth was weaker than in 2023. Employment rates rose by 0.12 percentage points (to 
72.1%) on average in the OECD between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, compared with 0.20 between Q1 2023 
and Q1 2024 (Figure 1.3, Panel A). Employment growth was also lower in 2024 than in 2023 in about half 
(20) of the 38 OECD countries, and even reached negative values in 16 countries. Nevertheless, 
employment rates accelerated remarkably in some of the countries where it was still well below or close to 
pre-COVID-19 levels in early 2024 (OECD, 2024[3]), and where there was therefore still some room for 
catching up: Colombia, Czechia, Lithuania and the United Kingdom. Costa Rica suffered significant and 
lasting employment losses after the pandemic but has recovered a significant portion of these over the 
past two years. 
In most OECD countries, the gender gap in employment rates narrowed over the past year (Figure 1.3, 
Panel A), continuing an evolution observed throughout the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis (OECD, 
2024[3]). Between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, on average across OECD countries, women’s employment rate 
increased by about 0.32 percentage points more than men’s. However, this represents 0.07 percentage 
points less than the gender gap reduction over the previous year. The even higher reduction in the gender 
employment gap between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024 might partly reflect the fact that some women returned 
to the labour market during the cost-of-living crisis to compensate for the loss of purchasing power linked 
to their husband’s earnings. Costa Rica and Lithuania recorded the biggest reduction in the gender gap in 
employment over the periods Q1 2023 – Q1 2024 and Q1 2024 – Q1 2025 respectively, showing that 
women benefited strongly from the employment catch-up in these countries over these periods. 
On average across OECD countries, the increase in the employment rate between Q1 2023 and Q1 2025 
is due for around a third to the increase in the employment rate of prime age workers (25-54), and for 
two-thirds to the increase in the employment rate of older workers (55-64) (Annex Figure 1.A.1, Panel A). 
By contrast, the employment rate of younger workers (15-24) fell slightly over the period. The increase in 
the employment rate of older workers is part of a trend that has been going on for two decades, analysed 
in detail in Chapter 3.

Rising employment rates were also driven by an increase in the employment rate of migrants in a number 
of countries, albeit to a small extent – among OECD EU countries, only in Belgium, Ireland, Slovenia and 
Spain does it account for more than a quarter of employment rate growth over the Q1 2023 – Q1 2025 
period (Annex Figure 1.A.2 Panel A) – see also Chapter 2. In addition, in these four countries, foreign-born 
individuals have been the main contributors to the growth in the absolute number of labour market 
participants over the recent period (Causa et al., 2025[6]). In terms of the employment gap, migrant 
employment was more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than that of natives, but rebounded more 
strongly, so that the employment rate gap between the two populations stabilised at a low level 
(0.6 percentage points) in 2022 on average across OECD countries (OECD, 2024[7]).

Labour force participation continued to rise 
In most OECD countries, the labour force participation rate of the working-age population continued to rise 
in 2024 (Figure 1.4, Panel A), reaching new records. At 76.6% in Q1 2025, the average labour force 
participation rate in the OECD was 0.17 percentage points higher than in Q1 2024, a smaller increase than 
between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. Nevertheless, in around a fifth of the countries, the Q1 2025 participation 
rate remains below its Q1 2023 level. 
Similar to employment, labour force participation increased more for women than for men over the past 
year in most OECD countries, so that the gender gap in participation rates narrowed by 0.3 percentage 
points between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 on average in the OECD (Figure 1.4, Panel B). The reduction in the 
gender participation gap has also slowed down: the gender gap reduction was 0.08 percentage points 
greater between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. 
Again similar to employment, the increase in the labour force participation rate between Q1 2023 and 
Q1 2025 is due solely to prime age and older workers (in approximately equal shares on average across 
OECD countries), and is significantly driven by a rising share of migrants participating in the labour market 
in only a few countries (Annex Figure 1.A.2 Panel B).

1.1.2. Labour markets are expected to slowdown in 2025 and 2026 
Geopolitical uncertainty and new bilateral tariff rates are expected to weaken economic activity and, as a 
result, labour markets (OECD, 2025[5]). Business investment, trade and consumption, are likely to decline, 
while inflation may rise in many countries. Monetary policy could therefore remain restrictive for longer 
than previously anticipated, further weakening growth prospects. 
Assuming that the bilateral tariff rates prevailing in mid‑May persist for the rest of 2025 and 2026, annual 
global GDP growth is expected to slow further from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.9% in 2025 and 2026 (OECD, 
2025[5]). OECD employment is also expected to slow down (Figure 1.5 Panel A): for the median OECD 
country, annual employment growth is projected to decline from 1% in 2024 to 0.7% over 2025-26. The 
median unemployment rate is projected to remain broadly stable, but there are notable differences 
between countries – in the United States, for example, the unemployment rate should rise from 4.1% in 
Q1 2025 (Section 1.1.1) to 4.3% in Q4 2026 (Figure 1.5 Panel B). However, these projections should be 
treated with caution, given the continuing uncertainty surrounding the new bilateral tariff rates.

1.1.3. Hours worked per capita continued their declining trend 
Between 2019 and 2024, in most OECD countries, hours worked per capita continued their downward 
trend. On average across the countries for which data are available, around a quarter of the 5.5% reduction 
in total hours worked per year since 2005 occurred since 2019 (Figure 1.6, Panel A). The decline therefore 
pre-dates the COVID-19 crisis in most countries, although significant accelerations can be observed since 
the crisis in some countries, including Austria, Germany, Ireland, the Slovak Republic and Spain. Average 
usual weekly working hours followed a similar trend (Panel B), although the decline was smaller – 3.6% 
between 2005 and 2023 on average across the countries analysed – and followed the same trend before 
and after the COVID-19 crisis in virtually all countries analysed. 
The decline in working hours could be explained by a number of factors, including shifts in worker 
preferences towards less overtime or more part-time employment, changes in working time regulation or 
collective agreements (OECD, 2021[8]), but also compositional shifts towards jobs requiring fewer working 
hours. Evidence from Europe suggests that the downward trend in hours worked over the past 20 years

reflects worker preferences for part-time employment rather than regulatory changes or compositional 
effects (Astinova et al., 2024[9]; ECB, 2021[10]). However, the recent reduction since the COVID-19 crisis 
has not been associated with a widespread increase in part-time employment (see Section 1.2.3 below).

1.2. Labour shortages continued to ease but labour markets remain tight 
Labour shortages were widespread following the COVID-19 crisis. Labour demand rose considerably to 
catch up after the crisis (OECD, 2024[3]), while matching efficiency deteriorated significantly during the 
pandemic and early recovery period (OECD, 2024[1]). In theory, labour shortages should drive down 
involuntary part-time employment, as firms find it increasingly difficult to fill full-time vacancies and wish to 
attract more workers (OECD, 2023[11]; OECD, 2018[12]). Yet, the previous section shows that, between 
2019 and 2023, weekly working hours generally did not deviate from the downward trend that had begun 
well before the COVID-19 crisis. The objective of this section is to better understand the link between 
labour shortages, labour market tightness and part-time employment during the cost-of-living crisis and 
the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. 
1.2.1. Labour market tightness is back to pre-COVID-19 levels in many countries and 
sectors but remains high 
By Q1 2025, labour market tightness (measured by the number of vacancies per unemployed person) had 
returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in many of the countries analysed. It was well below the post-COVID-19 
peak in virtually all countries (Figure 1.7, Panel A) but remained remarkably above pre-crisis levels in 
several. Labour market tightness was more than 10% above pre-crisis levels in almost half (11) of the 
25 countries analysed: Australia, France, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, 
the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Spain. In the Euro area, in April 2025, one in six firms in industry and 
one in four firms in services cited lack of labour as a one of the factors limiting production. While these 
figures are well below the post-pandemic peaks (about one in four in industry and one in three in services), 
they are above the pre-pandemic records of 2019.1 
Job postings data from the online platform Indeed2 completes the picture, showing declining trends in 
recent months: in May 2025, online job postings were below their December 2025 levels in the seven 
countries for which data are available (Figure 1.7, Panel B).3 However, the declining trend has slowed 
down (or even reversed) in most of these countries in April-May 2025.

Figure 1.7. Labour market tightness has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in many countries 
 
Note: OECD is the unweighted average of the 24 OECD countries shown in Panel A of this chart (not including Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Switzerland and Türkiye). The peak (Panel A) refers to the 
maximum value of the number of vacancies per unemployed reached in Q4 2019-Q1 2025. For Latvia, the number of vacancies per unemployed 
remains always below its Q4 2019 level and consequently there is no peak during the period considered. In Panel A, statistics do not include 
vacancies in the public administration and compulsory social security. 
In Panel A, statistics refer to the number of vacancies (see description below) divided by the number of unemployed (ILO definition). The definition of 
vacancies is not harmonised across countries, which limits international comparability. For European countries, a vacancy is defined as a paid post that 
is newly created, unoccupied, or about to become vacant for which the employer is taking active steps and is prepared to take further steps to find a 
suitable candidate from outside the enterprise concerned; and which the employer intends to fill either immediately or within a specific period. For 
Australia, a vacancy is defined as a job available for immediate filling and for which recruitment action has been taken by the employer. For Canada, a 
vacancy is defined as a job meeting the following conditions: it is vacant on the reference date (first day of the month) or will become vacant during the 
month; there are tasks to be carried out during the month for the job in question; and the employer is actively seeking a worker outside the organisation 
to fill the job. The jobs could be full-time, part-time, permanent, temporary, casual, or seasonal. Jobs reserved for subcontractors, external consultants, 
or other workers who are not considered employees, are excluded. For the United Kingdom, a vacancy is defined as a position for which employers are 
actively seeking recruits from outside their business or organisation (excluding agriculture, forestry, and fishing) based on the estimates from the Vacancy 
Survey. For the United States, a vacancy is defined as a job that is not filled on the last business day of the month and a job is considered open if a 
specific position exists and there is work available for it, the job can be started within 30 days, and there is active recruiting for the position. 
In Panel B, online job postings on Indeed are indexed to 100 in December 2024.

To capture labour market tightness at industry level, Figure 1.8 provides an overview of the industry-
specific vacancy rates (i.e. the fraction of all jobs available in the industry that are unfilled and for which 
employers report that they are actively trying to recruit) in Australia, the euro area and the United States. 
In Q1 2025, in both the euro area and the United States, labour market tightness was close to or below 
pre-COVID-19 levels in many sectors, including some where the peak in tightness had been particularly 
high, such as accommodation and food service activities (Figure 1.8). Labour market tightness remained 
more than 10% above pre-crisis levels (i) in the euro area: in arts and entertainment, manufacturing, 
finance, and trade; (ii) in the United States: in education, manufacturing, real estate, and other 
(unclassified) service sectors. 
In Australia, however, labour market tightness remained substantially above pre-COVID-19 levels in most 
sectors, particularly those where peak tightness had been among the highest: accommodation and food 
service activities, manufacturing, and real estate – labour market tightness in these three sectors remained 
above pre-COVID-19 levels by 141%, 72% and 101%, respectively.

vacancy rate reached in Q4 2019-Q1 2025. Industries refer to the ANZSIC 2006 at 1-digit level for Australia, the NACE Rev. 2 at 1-digit level for the 
Euro Area and to the NAICS for the United States and are therefore not fully comparable between these three countries. For the United States,

Despite these developments, labour market tightness remains high in the OECD. Indeed, pre-COVID-19 
labour markets were already tight for a number of structural reasons that are still at play, including 
population ageing (Chapter 2), the digital and green transformations (Dorville, Filippucci and Marcolin, 
forthcoming[13]) and poor job quality in some sectors (Causa et al., 2025[6]). 
1.2.2. Matching efficiency deteriorated between the onset of the pandemic and 
mid-2022 but is now back to pre-pandemic levels 
Beyond labour market tightness, labour shortages are influenced by the efficiency of matching between 
employers and jobseekers. The Beveridge curve illustrates the relationship between the unemployment 
rate (x-axis) and the job vacancy rate (y-axis), plotting different points in time. During economic downturns, 
unemployment rises as job vacancies fall, while the opposite occurs during upturns, so that the Beveridge 
curve has a negative slope. An outward shift in the Beveridge curve implies that a given level of 
unemployment is associated with a higher number of vacancies, and that it is more difficult for firms to fill 
existing vacancies with qualified jobseekers. This may therefore be interpreted as a reduction in matching 
efficiency. 
Matching efficiency deteriorated between the onset of the pandemic and mid-2022 but is now back to 
pre-pandemic levels in Australia, the euro area and the United States. Indeed, the corresponding 
Beveridge curves shifted outward between Q4 2019 and mid-2022 but have now returned to pre-pandemic 
patterns (Figure 1.9), although the level of tension is now higher (Q1 2025 is further to the left of the curve 
than Q4 2019) in Australia and in the euro area. Figure 1.9 Panel B and C also show that matching 
efficiency declined persistently in both the United States and the euro area after the 2008 global financial 
crisis (no data is available before Q4 2009 for Australia), notably due to growing skills mismatches and 
rising long-term unemployment (OECD, 2024[1]). It should be noted that movements of the Beveridge curve 
between two points in time cannot be interpreted as movements in matching efficiency (nor can they be 
compared between Europe and the United States) when the use of short-term work (in Europe) and/or 
temporary layoffs (in the United States) were high at those points in time – e.g. for periods starting/finishing 
in 2020-21 (OECD, 2021[8]).4 However, this does not apply to differences between Q4 2019 and mid-2022, 
as the exceptional measures taken in response to the pandemic had largely been rolled back by the end 
of 2021 (OECD, 2022[2]).

1.2.3. Tight labour markets may have contributed to changes in part-time 
employment patterns 
Part-time employment can be voluntary or involuntary.5 On the one hand, individuals may choose to work 
part-time, for example to achieve a better work-life balance. On the other hand, part-time employment may 
reflect difficulties in finding full-time work,6 particularly in certain service sectors where part-time 
employment is often used to cope with daily variations in demand (OECD, 2019[14]; Euwals and 
Hogerbrugge, 2006[15]). Involuntary part-time workers tend to receive lower hourly wages and experience 
poorer working conditions than similar full-time or voluntary part-time workers (MacDonald, 2019[16]). 
Part-time employment in OECD countries is largely female-dominated (Figure 1.10 Panel A) and mainly 
voluntary (with the exception of Italy) (Panel B). On average across the countries analysed, part-time jobs 
accounted for 17.6% of total employment in 2023, and 71% of these were held by women. The average 
incidence of involuntary part-time employment was 2.8%, around five times lower than that of voluntary 
part-time employment (14.8%). The predominantly voluntary nature of part-time employment is particularly 
marked in the five European countries where part-time employment is most widespread (Austria, Denmark, 
Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland7) (Figure 1.10 Panel B).

The relative stability of part-time employment masks larger offsetting changes in voluntary 
and involuntary part-time 
In most OECD countries, the incidence of part-time employment8 remained stable over the 2021-23 period 
(Figure 1.11, Panel A), a period of post-COVID-19 recovery and remarkable tightening of the labour market.9 
The magnitude of the change in the incidence of part-time employment was greater than 10% in only four of 
the 33 countries analysed – Czechia (+21%), Greece (-11%), Hungary (-12%) and Latvia (-12%). This may 
seem counter-intuitive since, in theory, tighter labour markets should encourage firms to make less use of 
involuntary part-time, to attract more workers and help fill full-time vacancies (OECD, 2018[12]). 
However, the relative stability of part-time employment masks larger, offsetting changes in voluntary and 
involuntary part-time. Involuntary part-time employment declined. However, voluntary part-time increased at 
the same time. The changes in voluntary and involuntary part-time are of opposite sign but similar magnitude 
on average across the countries analysed (Figure 1.11, Panel A). On average across these countries, 
voluntary part-time accounts for around a quarter of employment growth over the 2021-23 period (Panel B).

Note: Involuntary part-time employment refers to part-time workers who could not find full-time job. Part-time employment is based on national 
definitions. The OECD is the unweighted average of the 33 OECD countries shown (not including Costa Rica, Iceland, Korea, Mexico, and 
Türkiye). Total employment refers to full-time and part-time workers aged 15-64, excluding the unclassified. Therefore, the employment rates 
(Panel B) are not necessarily the same as the working age employment rates currently published by the OECD. Panel A: involuntary part-time 
and voluntary part-time refer to the contributions of each of these forms of employment to the percentage change in the incidence of part-time 
employment in working-age employment. Panel B: involuntary part-time, voluntary part-time and full-time refer to the contributions of each of 
these forms of employment to the percentage change in the working-age employment rate.

Tight labour markets may have contributed to changes in part-time employment patterns 
Both women and men benefited from the reduction in involuntary part-time. Although there are notable 
differences between countries, the percentage reduction in the incidence of involuntary part-time in total 
employment is similar (and around 17%) among women and men on average across the countries 
analysed in Figure 1.12. Furthermore, there is no major difference in the nature of the reduction in 
involuntary part-time by gender (Figure 1.13): for both women and men, part-time weekly working hours 
above 20 hours (referred to as long part-time working hours or LPT) play a more important role, probably 
because they are the easiest to convert into full-time working hours.

The increase in voluntary part-time also concerns both women and men, although the percentage increase 
for women is less than half that for men (4% for women vs. 9% for men on average across the countries 
analysed) (Figure 1.12). The nature of the increase also differs by gender: while LPT again plays a more 
important role among women, the situation is more balanced among men, with only half of the increase 
due to LPT on average across the countries analysed in Figure 1.13 – the other half is therefore due to 
weekly working hours below 20 hours, referred to as short part-time working hours or SPT.

These developments are consistent with the notion that some workers switched from full-time to part-time 
work because: (i) their preferences shifted from work to family commitments during the COVID-19 crisis; 
and (ii) employers became more willing to meet part-time work requests as labour markets tightened and 
workers’ bargaining power became stronger. Increases in voluntary part-time via this mechanism would 
have been strongest for men, as women were much more committed to the family than men before the 
COVID-19 crisis (Andrew et al., 2022[17]; Hupkau and Petrongolo, 2020[18]; Sevilla and Smith, 2020[19]). In 
other words, fathers may have enjoyed or got used to working less and spending more time with their 
families when the COVID-19 restrictions were in force (Alon et al., 2020[20]) and decided to modify their 
working arrangements accordingly when the restrictions were lifted and their bargaining position became 
more favourable. 
Another mechanism at play could be that non-working household members have decided to (re-)enter the 
labour market on a part-time basis to compensate for the loss of purchasing power of their main source of 
income (e.g. social benefits or partner’s wage) when hit by the cost-of-living crisis. This mechanism would 
affect more women than men, as women are less likely to be the household’s main breadwinner. 
As expected, the negative contribution of involuntary part-time to the change in total part-time employment 
is particularly strong between 2021 and 2022 (Annex Figure 1.A.3, Panels A and B), when labour market 
tightness increased the most (Annex Figure 1.A.4). In contrast, the positive contribution of voluntary part-
time is balanced over the periods 2021-22 and 2022-23, which is consistent with the above mechanisms: 
although most of the changes in real wages and labour market tightness occurred between 2021 and 2022, 
real wages remained low – so economic hardship remained high – and labour markets (particularly) tight 
– so workers’ bargaining power remained high – until 2023. Again in line with the above mechanism, the

positive contribution of voluntary part-time to the change in total part-time employment does not hold over 
the period 2019-21 (Annex Figure 1.A.3, Panel C). 
These results may have implications in terms of wage inequality. On the one hand, the reduction in 
involuntary part-time could have reduced labour market slack for some – generally lower-wage – groups and 
sectors for which it was high, exerting upward wage pressure for these groups and thus reinforcing wage 
compression. On the other hand, SPT is likely to be associated with low monthly and annual wages, so the 
greater increase in voluntary SPT among men may have contributed to reducing the gender wage gap. 
Whether these trends reflect a temporary adjustment phase or persistent changes remains an open 
question. Involuntary part-time may stabilise, as labour market tightness has returned to pre-pandemic 
level in many countries (Section 1.2.1). In addition, it is unclear to what extent the changes in preferences 
induced by the pandemic will persist over time. 
1.3. Real wages are growing in virtually all OECD countries but there is still room 
for catching up in many of them 
In all countries analysed, headline inflation is now a long way from its 2022 peak (Figure 1.14). In Q1 2025, 
inflation in the OECD area (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) was 4.5%, less than half of its 
Q3 2022 level (10.4%), but still above 2%, which is the central bank target for many OECD countries 
(e.g. the euro area, the United Kingdom and the United States). Inflation remains above this target in 
28 OECD countries – 40% in Türkiye and above 4% in six other OECD countries.

1.3.1. Real wages are growing year-on-year in virtually all OECD countries but 
remain below early 2021 levels in half of them 
According to the latest data for Q1 2025,10 annual real wage growth was positive in virtually all 
OECD countries, with an average of 2.5% across the 37 countries for which data are available (Figure 1.15 
Panel A).11 Only in Belgium, Iceland, Israel and Japan, was annual real wage growth negative in Q1 2025, 
but the reduction in real wages was generally modest (1% or less).12 Recent data on wages posted in 
online vacancies for nine countries point to a slowdown in the growth of real posted wages over 
recent months (Box 1.1). 
In Q1 2025, despite their persistent annual growth, real wages remained below their Q1 202113 level 
(which pre-dates the post-pandemic inflation surge) in half of the 37 countries for which data are available 
(Figure 1.15, Panel B). Real wages remained more than 3% below Q1 2021 levels in a quarter of the 
countries analysed: Australia, New Zealand, three Nordic countries (Denmark,14 Finland, Sweden) and 
four southern and central and eastern European countries (Czechia, Italy, the Slovak Republic and Spain). 
Nonetheless, real wages regained some (at least 17% – in New Zealand) of the lost ground in all 
OECD countries. 
Several factors may have influenced wage growth over the last year. While the easing of labour market 
tightness described in the previous section may have been a moderating factor for new hires, the increase 
in statutory minimum wages (see next section) and further adjustments in wages negotiated in collective 
agreements (Box 1.2) – negotiated wages are renewed on average every 12 to 24 months (OECD, 
2023[21]) – continued to exert upward pressures. In the future, however, the wage recovery could be 
jeopardised, as geopolitical uncertainties and hikes in tariff rates may significantly weaken labour markets 
while exerting further upward pressure on inflation (OECD, 2025[5]).

Note: nominal hourly wages refer to a constant-industry-structure “wages and salaries” component of the labour cost index, except if otherwise indicated. For 
Costa Rica and Mexico, the adjustment for constant-industry-structure of the average hourly earnings has been estimated by the OECD. Statistics refer to 
the private sector only for Costa Rica, Japan, Korea, Mexico and the United States. For Türkiye, statistics exclude public administration and defence; 
compulsory social security; education; human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other service activities. Nominal wage 
series are seasonally adjusted for all countries except for Canada, Costa Rica, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand and Switzerland. Statistics for Chile refer to 
regular hourly wages, excluding overtime and bonuses. Nominal hourly wage data in Mexico are affected by a significant share of employees with unreported 
income. 
†: Nominal hourly wage refers to the actual wage i.e. without any adjustment for sources of compositional shifts for Israel, Japan, Korea and the 
United Kingdom, and thus comparing these results with the other countries requires caution. Moreover, nominal hourly wage refers to the average monthly 
wages per employee job for Israel, and to the average weekly earnings for the United Kingdom. 
‡: Nominal hourly wage controls for additional sources of compositional shifts, such as regions for Australia, Canada, Chile, and New Zealand, job 
characteristics and workers’ characteristics for Australia, Chile, and New Zealand, gender for Chile and Switzerland, and occupations for Chile and the 
United States. Real hourly wage is estimated by deflating the nominal hourly wage by the consumer price index (CPI-all items). 
Countries are ordered by descending order of the year-on-year changes in real hourly wages (Panel A). The trough (Panel B) refers to the quarter where real 
hourly wages were at their lowest value for the indicated country since Q1 2021. For Switzerland, the trough (Panel B) refers to the lowest fourth quarter since 
Q4 2020. “OECD (average)” and “OECD (median)” are the unweighted average and the median, respectively, of the 37 OECD countries shown in this chart

Box 1.1 Wages advertised in online vacancies point to a recent slowdown in the growth of real 
posted wages 
Data from wages advertised in job postings on the online platform Indeed show decreasing or stable 
growth of real posted wages between November 2024 and April 2025 in the euro area and eight of the 
nine countries for which data are available. Real wage growth declined in six countries (Canada, Ireland, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United-Kingdom), remained stable in two (Germany and the 
United States), and rose in France only (Figure 1.16). In most areas where real wage growth decreased 
(Canada, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the euro area as a whole), this is due to both rising inflation and a 
deceleration in nominal wages. In fact, these data show no increase in the growth of nominal posted 
wages between November 2024 and April 2025. Nonetheless, in about half of the countries analysed, 
nominal and real wage growth picked up slightly towards the end of the period.

Box 1.2 Real negotiated wages in selected OECD countries have accentuated their upward trend but 
remain below the levels reached before the inflation surge 
Negotiated wages (i.e. wages defined in collective agreements, as opposed to the average wages received 
by workers) are now increasing in real terms in virtually all countries analysed but remain below the levels 
seen just before the post-COVID-19 inflation surge in all countries except Denmark, where they have fully 
recovered, and Mexico, where they did not fall with the inflation surge (Figure 1.17). 
Figure 1.17. Real negotiated wages in selected OECD countries 
Percentage change in real negotiated wages (i.e. resulting from collective agreements) since Q1 2021 
 
Note: International comparability of data on negotiated wages is affected by differences in definitions and measurement. Statistics are 
representative of all employees covered by a collective wage agreement for Austria, Belgium, the Euro Area (20), France, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. In Canada, statistics refer to collective bargaining settlements of all bargaining units covering 500 or 
more employees (units of 100 or more employees for the Federal Jurisdiction). In Denmark, statistics refer to collective agreements negotiated by 
the main union and employer confederations, FH and DA, and do not cover public sector employees and the academic unions (AC). For Australia, 
Canada and Mexico statistics refer only to employees affected by an increase of the negotiated wage at date. For Denmark, wage increases cover 
basic wages, employer pension contributions, “fritvalg” (flexible benefit) accounts, and other collectively agreed elements (e.g. wages in the event 
of sickness absence or maternity/paternity leave) from the five major sectoral collective agreements (the “breakthrough agreements”) that set the 
financial framework for the subsequent minimum wage agreements or standard wage agreements to be negotiated in the private sector. 
Calculations are based on the assumption of full relative pass-through of centrally negotiated wage rates to actual wage adjustments (i.e. a 1% 
increase in the minimum wage or standard wage rate leads to a 1% increase in locally negotiated wages higher up the wage distribution). Wage 
increases in Austria, Belgium, the Euro Area (20), Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States refers to the average increase 
in negotiated wages weighted by the employment composition for a reference year (Laspeyres index). The reference year of the employment 
composition used is 2009 for Sweden, 2010 for Belgium, 2015 for Germany and Italy, 2016 for Austria, 2020 for the Netherlands, 2021 for the 
United States, and January 2023 for the Euro Area (20). For Australia, Canada, France and Mexico wage increases refer to the average increase 
in negotiated wages weighted by the number of employees affected of the period considered. Private sector in Germany refers to all industries 
excluding agriculture, public administration, education, health, and other personal services (Sections B to N of the NACE rev. 2). Percentage 
changes for Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Euro Area, France, Mexico and Sweden are OECD estimates based on published year-on-year 
percentage changes and can therefore only be calculated between two similar quarters (Q1 in this chart). Statistics for Australia and Canada refer 
to the percentage change in Q4 2024 (Q4 2023 and Q4 2022) since Q4 2020. LS: wages including lump sums and/or special payments.

Real negotiated wages were higher in Q1 2025 than a year earlier in all the countries analysed, except for 
Belgium, where they had already stabilised around the levels seen in Q1 2021 by Q1 2023. Besides 
Belgium, real negotiated wages in Q1 2025 were close to (i.e. less than 2% below) Q1 2021 levels in Austria, 
France, the Netherlands and the United States. Real negotiated wages were already rising on an annual 
basis in Q1 2024 in Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the 
United States, and their growth slowed down over 2024 in about half of these countries (Austria, Denmark, 
France, the Netherlands and the United States). By contrast, real negotiated wage growth turned positive 
only in 2024 in Australia and Sweden (Annex Figure 1.A.6). Considering the euro area as a whole, real 
negotiated wages have stopped rising over the past year, although they remain 4.3% below their early 2021 
levels. 
The dynamics of real negotiated wages reflect a combination of factors, including the staggered and 
infrequent nature of collective bargaining, the time lag between the completion of negotiations and actual 
wage revisions, the infrequent use of automatic inflation indexation, and workers’ bargaining power (Araki 
et al., 2023[4]). Since the start of the cost-of-living crisis, as bargaining rounds have multiplied and affected 
a growing number of workers, negotiated wages have regained more and more of the ground lost during the 
inflation surge. 
Looking ahead, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) indicator of future growth in negotiated wages points to 
a gradual reduction in nominal negotiated wage growth in Europe from 5.3% in Q4 2024 to 1.6% in Q4 2025.1

1.3.2. The wages of the lowest-paid workers have proved more resilient than median 
wages to the inflation surge 
Statutory minimum wages in real terms are above their January 2021 level 
The real statutory minimum wage was higher in April 2025 than in January 2021 in virtually all of the 
30 OECD countries that have a national statutory minimum wage in place (Figure 1.18, Panel A). The real 
minimum wage was 7.9% higher in April 2025 than in January 2021 on average across these 30 countries, 
and the median increase, unaffected by outliers (e.g. Mexico), was 4.7%. The real minimum wage was 
lower in April 2025 than in January 2021 in only four countries – Korea, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and 
the United States. In the United States the nominal federal minimum wage has remained unchanged since 
2009, but state-level minimum wages have risen frequently in recent times, so that the reduction in the 
employment-weighted average of state-level real minimum wages between January 2021 and April 2025 
(-2.2%) is much smaller than that of the federal real minimum wage (-18.5%). 
Minimum wages have been able to keep pace with inflation thanks to automatic or discretionary increases 
in the nominal minimum wage, introduced by countries to support the lowest earners during the cost-of-
living crisis (Araki et al., 2023[4]). During 2022, the real gains resulting from these adjustments rapidly faded 
away on average across countries, as inflation continued to rise (Figure 1.18, Panel B). In 2023 and 2024, 
however, larger minimum wage adjustments and moderating inflation enabled the real minimum wage to 
catch up (in 2023) and exceed (in 2024) its January 2021 level on average across countries. 
There are indications of a compression of the wage distribution at the bottom 
In most OECD countries, statutory minimum wages have increased by more than median wages in 
recent years, favouring a compression of the wage distribution at the bottom. Figure 1.19 shows changes 
in the ratios of minimum wage to median wage (or Kaitz index) between 2021 and 2024. It shows an

increase in 22 of the 30 countries analysed. On average across the countries analysed, the Kaitz index 
rose from 55% in 2021 to 56.6% in 2024. This trend can be explained in part by the fact that wages 
negotiated in collective agreements generally need more time than the minimum wage to keep pace with 
inflation (Araki et al., 2023[4]), particularly in a context of weak productivity growth (OECD, 2024[22]) and a 
long-term trend of declining scope of collective agreements (OECD, 2019[23]). 
Figure 1.18. Real minimum wages are above January 2021 levels in virtually all countries 
 
Note: Change in real minimum wage in April 2025 compared to January 2021 for New Zealand (Panel A) is estimated by assuming that the CPI 
in April 2025 is the same as in Q1 2025. “OECD (average)” is the unweighted average of the 30 OECD countries shown except the United States 
(weighted) and “OECD (median) is the median values across the same countries. Canada (weighted) is a Laspeyres index based on minimum 
wage of provinces and territories (excluding the Federal Jurisdiction) weighted by the share of employees of provinces and territories in 2019. 
United States (weighted) is a Laspeyres index based on minimum wage of states (not including territories like Puerto Rico or Guam) weighted 
by the share of nonfarm private employees by state in 2019. For the Netherlands, the minimum wage is now defined in hourly terms, while it 
was defined on a daily, weekly and monthly basis before 1 January 2024. The hourly minimum wage before 2024 is therefore estimated based 
on the weekly (or daily) minimum wage of an employee usually working 40 hours per week (or 8 hours per day). See Appendix Table 1.C.1 of 
the 2024 employment outlook (OECD, 2024[24]) for more details on the calculations.

Figure 1.19. Statutory minimum wages have increased more than median wages in most countries 
Gross minimum wage as a percentage of gross median wage of full-time workers 
 
Note: The minimum wage for the United States is estimated by the sum of state-level minimum wages weighted by the number of nonfarm 
private sector employees in the state in 2019 from the State and Metro Area Employment, Hours, & Earnings published by the BLS. For the 
five states without a minimum wage (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee), the federal minimum wage is used. This 
estimate does not take into account any exemptions or derogations in force in the states. OECD is the unweighted average of the 
30 OECD countries shown. 2024 data are preliminary. Latest data available are from 2023 for Chile, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain and Türkiye.

StatLink 2 https://stat.link/n8k7sv 
In addition to the minimum wage, other factors may have influenced wage compression at the bottom of 
the distribution. Although empirical evidence is scarce for most countries, there are further indications of a 
compression of the wage distribution at the bottom in recent years in some countries (OECD, 2024[3]). 
Box 1.3 provides an insight into wage compression in two of these countries: France and the United States. 
While in France, minimum wage hikes and their spillovers to higher levels of the wage distribution were 
key in driving wage compression, in the United States the process was more generally driven by the 
tightening of the labour market. 
In particular, a factor behind these trends may be that low-pay service sectors saw a particularly marked 
increase in labour demand and labour market tightness in the early recovery from the COVID-19 crisis 
(OECD, 2023[11]; Causa et al., 2022[25]), leading to significant labour shortages (although these tensions 
are now easing). 
Yet, while there is a clear trend towards wage compression between sectors in the United States over the 
Q1 2021 - Q1 2025 period, this is not the case in Australia or in the euro area. In the United States, 
accommodation and food service activities is by far the sector with the strongest real wage growth (+3%) 
(Figure 1.20) – possibly due, at least in part, to the remarkable peak in sectoral labour market tightness for 
this sector over the period15 (Section 1.2.1). This is also a sector where wages are relatively low. On the 
other hand, the five sectors with the biggest real wage declines are finance (-9.4% wage growth), followed 
by information and communication (-5.3%), education (-3.9%), construction (-3.3%), and business services 
(-3.1%), all sectors where wages tend to be relatively high. This wage compression had already begun 
during the post-pandemic inflation surge, when real wages fell more in higher-wage sectors; but it was 
reinforced by the fact that the subsequent wage recovery was weaker in some of these sectors. The picture 
is more mixed in the euro area, where two high-wage sectors (finance and business services) are among 
the sectors with the smallest wage reductions (or highest increases), while arts and entertainment, where

wages tend to be low, records the biggest wage decline. Similarly, in Australia, where wage growth is much 
more homogeneous across sectors, no pattern of wage compression emerges. 
The situation is less clear-cut in some other OECD countries (Annex Figure 1.A.8). Some patterns of wage 
compression between sectors can be observed in Chile, Denmark, Iceland, Korea, Norway, Mexico and 
Poland, but they are significantly less marked than in the United States. 
Figure 1.20. There is a clear trend towards wage compression between sectors in the United States 
but not in Australia and the euro area 
Percentage change in real hourly wages since Q1 2021 
 
Note: Nominal hourly wages refer to a constant-industry-structure “wages and salaries” component of the labour cost index for the Euro Area, 
and controls for additional occupational shifts for Australia and the United States. Real hourly wage is estimated by deflating the nominal hourly 
wage with the consumer price index (CPI-all items). The trough refers to the minimum value of the percentage change in real hourly wage since 
Q1 2021. Industries refer to the ANZSIC 2006 at the 1-digit level for Australia, the NACE Rev. 2 at the 1-digit level for the Euro Area and the 
NAICS for the United States and are therefore not fully comparable between these three countries. Changes in real wages in the Wholesale and 
retail trade industry in the United States refer to the employment-weighted averages of the wholesale and retail trade industries based on non-
farm payroll employment in these industries in Q4 2005. Similarly, changes in real wages in the Arts and entertainment industry in the 
United States is derived from statistics for the Leisure and Hospitality industry and Accommodations and Food Service industry using non-farm 
payroll employment in these industries in Q4 2005. Industries are ranked by the median wage in 2018 in the European Structure of Earnings 
Survey (SES). The ranking of industries is broadly consistent when 2019 data on median wages from the Current Population Survey of the 
United States are used.

Box 1.3. The compression of the wage distribution in France and the United States may reflect 
different phenomena 
The compression of the wage distribution in France since the COVID-19 crisis can be linked to the 
significant minimum wage increases over the period and their spillovers to higher levels of the wage 
distribution (Bozio and Wasmer, 2024[26]; Groupe d’experts sur le salaire minimum interprofessionnel 
de croissance, 2024[27]). Looking at the period 2006-22, there is a remarkable compression of the wage 
distribution between 2018 and 2022 (Figure 1.21), when the French minimum wage – Salaire Minimum 
Interprofessionnel de Croissance (SMIC) – increased dramatically to keep pace with high inflation – the 
SMIC is indexed to inflation, unlike other wages.

France 
Percentage of private sector employees aged 18-64 (main job) 
 
Reading: In 2022, 1.5% of private sector employees aged 18-64 earn a gross hourly wage equivalent to 1.22 times the minimum wage. 
Note: Statistics refer to private sector employees (excluding salaried self-employed) aged 18-64 in their main job (i.e. highest paid in terms

politiques-dexonerations-de-cotisations-sociales-une-inflexion.

In the United States, on the other hand, it was the tightening of the labour market rather than minimum 
wage increases that enabled some low-wage workers to benefit from substantial wage increases (Autor, 
Dube and McGrew, 2023[28]). Although likely amplified by the surge in tightness after the pandemic, 
these developments predate the COVID-19 crisis (Aeppli and Wilmers, 2022[29])1 and might therefore 
still be at work despite the recent easing of tensions to pre-COVID-19 levels (Figure 1.7), leaving scope 
for further wage compression. For example, the latest compensation plan for employees of warehouse 
store company Sam’s club (owned and operated by Walmart), implemented in November 2024, 
suggests that tensions might still be high for low-wage occupations in the retail sector. The new plan 
raised the hourly wages from USD 15 to USD 16 for entry-level workers, and increased wage growth 
by up to 6% depending on years of service.2

tightening of the labour market since the recovery from the global financial crisis.

1.3.3. As real wages keep on recovering, unit profits continue to lose the ground 
gained during the inflation surge 
Unit labour costs16 grew more than unit profits between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 in most OECD countries 
(Figure 1.22), continuing a trend that began around Q1 2023 (OECD, 2024[3]). In fact, unit profits even fell 
over the period in around a third of the countries analysed. In Australia and in the euro area, the contribution 
of unit profits to domestic price pressures dropped over 2023 to early 2024 (mostly in Q2 2023 for 
Australia), then remaining at historically low levels (Figure 1.23).

These developments reflect the catching-up of purchasing power by wages, rather than a warning sign of 
price-wage spirals. On the one hand, unit profits continue to lose the ground gained during the inflation 
surge of 2021-22, when they were making an unusually large contribution to domestic price pressures 
(Araki et al., 2023[4]). On the other hand, wage pressures are expected to ease over the second half of 
202517 (Bates, Bodnár and Schlieker, 2024[30]). 
The United States stands out from the above trends, with unit profits growing slightly more than unit labour 
costs (albeit at a modest pace) between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 (Figure 1.22). Looking further back, the 
relative contribution of unit profits to domestic price pressures in the United States has stabilised in late 
2023 around pre-pandemic levels, following a sharp fall in early 2023 (Figure 1.23). 
1.4. Concluding remarks 
OECD labour markets have continued to show resilience over the past year despite a significant slowdown 
in economic activity in most OECD countries. Employment and labour force participation have reached 
record highs, while unemployment remains historically low. However, there are signs of weakening labour 
markets, with employment growth decelerating and labour market tightness in many countries and sectors 
falling back to pre-COVID-19 levels, although labour shortages remain. 
There is some evidence that the exceptionally tight labour markets during the recovery period may have 
affected part-time employment patterns: involuntary part-time work has declined, while voluntary part-time 
– by men in particular – has increased. Whether these trends reflect a temporary adjustment phase, or 
persistent changes will depend on the evolution of unemployment and labour market tightness, as well as 
the lasting effects of the pandemic on gender norms. 
Despite the easing of labour market tightness, real wages are now growing virtually everywhere in the 
OECD, but their levels remain below the levels seen in early 2021 – just before the post-pandemic inflation 
surge – in half of OECD countries. The wages of the lowest-paid workers have held up particularly well, 
as real statutory minimum wages were increased since then in virtually all the 30 OECD countries with a 
national minimum wage. As real wages continue to recover, unit profits continue to lose the ground gained 
since 2021. 
Looking ahead, geopolitical uncertainties and hikes in tariff rates are expected to affect economic activity, 
and bring back the risk of high inflation. Employment and social policies (e.g. unemployment insurance, 
social assistance, active labour market policies, collective bargaining) will be essential to address the 
potential negative consequences of these shocks on employment. In addition, in the context of limited risks 
of a price-wage spiral – with wage pressure expected to ease in 2025 –, well-designed and implemented 
collective bargaining and social dialogue have a role to play in ensuring that the cost of inflation is fairly 
distributed between workers and employers (and between workers at different wage levels).

Note: Otherwise indicated, nominal hourly wages refer to a constant-industry-structure “wages and salaries” component of the labour cost index. 
For Costa Rica and Mexico, the adjustment for constant-industry-structure of the average hourly earnings has been estimated by the OECD. 
Statistics refer to the private sector only for Costa Rica, Japan, Korea, Mexico and the United States. For Türkiye, statistics exclude public 
administration and defence; compulsory social security; education; human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; 
and other service activities. Nominal wage series are seasonally adjusted for all countries except for Canada, Costa Rica, Israel, Mexico, 
New Zealand and Switzerland. Statistics for Chile refer to regular hourly wages, excluding overtime and bonuses. Nominal hourly wage presents 
a significant amount of unreported income for Mexico, with a notable increase in Q1 2025. 
Nominal hourly wage refers to the actual wage i.e. without any adjustment for sources of compositional shifts for Israel, Japan, Korea and the 
United Kingdom, and thus comparing these results with the other countries requires caution. Moreover, nominal hourly wage refers to the 
average monthly wages per employee job for Israel, and to the average weekly earnings for the United Kingdom. 
Nominal hourly wage controls for additional sources of compositional shifts, such as regions for Australia, Canada, Chile and New Zealand, job 
characteristics and workers’ characteristics for Australia, Chile and New Zealand, gender for Chile and Switzerland, and occupations for Chile 
and the United States. Real hourly wage is estimated by deflating the nominal hourly wage by the consumer price index (CPI-all items). 
“OECD (average)” and “OECD (median)” are the unweighted average and the median, respectively, of 37 OECD countries (not including 
Colombia).

Note: International comparability of data on negotiated wages is affected by differences in definitions and measurement. Statistics are 
representative of all employees covered by a collective wage agreement for Austria, Belgium, the Euro Area (20), France, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. In Canada, statistics refer to collective bargaining settlements of all bargaining units covering 500 
or more employees (units of 100 or more employees for the Federal Jurisdiction). In Denmark, statistics refer to collective agreements negotiated 
by the main union and employer confederations, FH and DA, and do not cover public sector employees and the academic unions (AC). For 
Australia, Canada and Mexico statistics refer only to employees affected by an increase of the negotiated wage at date. For Denmark, wage 
increases cover basic wages, employer pension contributions, “fritvalg” (flexible benefit) accounts, and other collectively agreed elements 
(e.g. wages in the event of sickness absence or maternity/paternity leave) from the five major sectoral collective agreements (the “breakthrough 
agreements”) that set the financial framework for the subsequent minimum wage agreements or standard wage agreements to be negotiated in 
the private sector. Calculations are based on the assumption of full relative pass-through of centrally negotiated wage rates to actual wage 
adjustments (i.e. a 1% increase in the minimum wage or standard wage rate leads to a 1% increase in locally negotiated wages higher up the 
wage distribution). Wage increases in Austria, Belgium, the Euro Area (20), Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States 
refers to the average increase in negotiated wages weighted by the employment composition for a reference year (Laspeyres index). The 
reference year of the employment composition used is 2009 for Sweden, 2010 for Belgium, 2015 for Germany and Italy, 2016 for Austria, 2020 
for the Netherlands, 2021 for the United States, and January 2023 for the Euro Area (20). For Australia, Canada, France and Mexico wage 
increases refer to the average increase in negotiated wages weighted by the number of employees affected of the period considered. Private 
sector in Germany refers to all industries excluding agriculture, public administration, education, health, and other personal services (Sections B 
to N of the NACE rev. 2).

Note: Canada (weighted) is a Laspeyres index based on minimum wage of provinces and territories (excluding the Federal Jurisdiction) weighted 
by the share of employees of provinces and territories in 2019. United States (weighted) is a Laspeyres index based on minimum wage of states 
(not including territories like Puerto Rico or Guam) weighted by the share of nonfarm private employees by state in 2019. Changes in nominal 
minimum wage in Belgium in April and May 2022 relate to the transition to a single rate for workers aged 18 and over. “OECD (median)” is the 
median across the 30 OECD countries with statutory minimum wage (not including the Canada Federal Jurisdiction and the weighted average 
for the United States). Change in real minimum wage in April 2025 for New Zealand is estimated by assuming that the CPI is the same as in 
Q1 2025. For the Netherlands, the minimum wage is now defined in hourly terms, while it was defined on a daily, weekly and monthly basis 
before 1 January 2024. The hourly minimum wage before 2024 is therefore estimated based on the weekly (or daily) minimum wage of an 
employee usually working 40 hours per week (or 8 hours per day). See Appendix Table 1.C.1 of the 2024 employment outlook (OECD, 2024[24]) 
for more details on the calculations.

Note: Real wages are obtained by deflating nominal wages by consumer price inflation (all items). Industries are ranked by the median wage in 
2018 in the European Structure of Earnings Survey (SES). The ranking of industries is broadly consistent when 2019 data on median wages 
from the Current Population Survey of the United States are used. 
Industries are ordered from low- to high-pay industries as follows: 1. Accommodation and food service, 2. Administrative and support service, 
3. Arts, entertainment and recreation, 4. Wholesale and retail trade; 5. Transportation and storage, 6. Manufacturing, 7. Other service, 8. Real 
estate activities, 9. Construction; 10. Human health and social work, 11. Education, 12. Professional activities, 13. Information and 
communication, and 14. Finance and insurance. 
Series are not seasonally adjusted for Canada, Chile, Japan, Korea, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Statistics for the accommodation and 
food service sector are not available for Denmark. For Türkiye, statistics exclude public administration and defence; compulsory social security; 
education; human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other service activities. Nominal hourly wage presents 
a significant amount of unreported income for Mexico, with a notable increase in Q1 2025, and hence statistics refer to the period Q1 2021 to 
Q4 2024. The trough refers to the quarter where real hourly wages were at their lowest value for the indicated industry since Q1 2021.

2 Indeed data are subject to a number of limitations, including the over-representation of high-skilled jobs 
and the under-representation of low skilled jobs, jobs posted by small firms and the agricultural sector. 
Nevertheless, there is evidence that job postings at the aggregate level tend to track well with job vacancies 
from government sources (Adrjan and Lydon, 2023[32]; Adrjan et al., 2021[34]; Bellatin and Galassi, 2022[33]; 
Ciminelli et al., 2024[35]). 
3 In Canada, there is evidence that the decline in the number of job vacancies observed since the summer 
of 2022 stopped towards the end of the summer of 2024, and has remained relatively stable since then, 
although certain sectors, such as healthcare and education, have continued to post higher number of job 
offers 
(see 
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410040001&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=01&cub
eTimeFrame.startYear=2015&cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=10&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2024&referenc
ePeriods=20150101%2C20241001). 
4 In Europe, due to short-time work, unemployment was artificially depressed at the start of the pandemic, 
without any real change of matching efficiency. The opposite occurred in the United States, where 
temporary laid off workers where initially not searching for jobs. 
5 Full-time employment can also be involuntary, with some full-time workers wishing to work fewer hours 
(ILO, 2022[37]). 
6 Throughout this section, involuntary part-time workers are defined as workers working part-time 
(according to national definition) in their main job because they could not find a full-time job. 
7 In Switzerland, partner income might be one of the reasons why many women start working limited hours 
at childbearing age, contributing to Switzerland’s place among the European OECD countries with the 
highest share of workers working less than 20 hours a week (Georgieff, 2024[36]). 
8 Throughout this section, the population of interest is the working-age population (15-64). However, the 
analyses have been replicated for the 25-54 age group, and the results remain qualitatively unchanged. 
9 The post-COVID19 surge in labour market tightness took place between 2021-22 in virtually all 
OECD countries for which data are available (Annex Figure 1.A.4). 
10 Nominal hourly wage data are affected by a significant share of employees with unreported income for 
Mexico, with a notable increase in Q1 2025. Data for Mexico are therefore reported only up to Q4 2024. 
11 Most of the data used in this section refer to the “wages and salaries” component of the Labour Cost 
Index (i.e. excluding employer’s social security contributions) produced by Eurostat – or similar measure 
for non-European countries (see notes to the figures for the details on the countries for which different 
wage measures have been used). In addition to separating wages from other labour cost components, 
these indicators have two main advantages relative to measures of compensation per hour worked derived 
from National Accounts. First, they are generally constructed to follow the evolution of hourly nominal 
wages for a constant industry structure, therefore minimising the potential impact of compositional changes

on aggregate wage dynamics. Second, they are available at a more detailed sectoral breakdown than 
measures of compensation of employees from National Accounts, allowing the analysis on wage dynamics 
by industry of different pay levels of the next section. 
12 In Belgium, real wages had already returned to their pre-COVID-19 levels by Q3 2023 (OECD, 2024[31]). 
13 Examining wage growth since Q4 2019 instead of Q1 2021 reveals positive wage changes in a greater 
number of countries. However, using Q1 2021 as the reference quarter is more relevant than pre-COVID 
data (Q4 2019) for analysing the wage recovery from the inflation surge. Nominal wage index series since 
Q4 2019 show that the artificial increase in wages induced by composition effects during the pandemic 
had subsided by Q1 2021 in virtually all OECD countries (Annex Figure 1.A.5). 
14 Figure 1.15 shows a 3.7% reduction in real wages between Q1 2021 and Q1 2025 in Denmark, while 
the Danish standardised index of average earnings has returned to pre-inflation levels. This is because 
the labour cost index used in Figure 1.15 refers to a constant industry structure, while the standardised 
index of average earnings is adjusted for both the industrial and occupational structure. 
15 Accommodation and food service activities is the only sector where the average real wage did not 
decrease during the post-COVID-19 inflation surge. 
16 To enable a comparison of the dynamics between labour costs and profits, this section uses indicators 
from the National Accounts (see note to Figure 1.22). Using the income approach, nominal GDP can be 
decomposed as 𝑃𝑌= 𝑁𝐶𝐸+ 𝐺𝑂𝑆+ 𝑇𝐴𝑋𝑁 where 𝑃 is the GDP deflator, 𝑌 is real GDP, 𝑁𝐶𝐸 is nominal 
compensation of employees, 𝐺𝑂𝑆 is gross operating surplus, and 𝑇𝐴𝑋𝑁 is nominal taxes. Unit labour costs 
and profits are derived by dividing the two relevant GDP components by real GDP. Unit labour costs 
increase when growth in compensation exceeds growth in real GDP or, dividing these two components by 
hours worked, when growth in compensation per hour worked exceeds growth in labour productivity. This 
measure of unit labour costs differs in some important respects from the measure of hourly wages based 
on the “wages and salaries” component of the labour cost index used in the previous sections (see 
note 11). Most notably, unit labour costs include employer’s social security contributions and do not control 
for changes in the sectoral composition of the economy.

Opposing trends in longevity and fertility imply that the OECD population is 
becoming older. Without further policy action, the retirement of large 
cohorts will shrink the pool of productive workers, while the dependent 
population will expand. This chapter assesses the projected impact of these 
trends on GDP per capita growth to 2060 and puts them, as well as their 
implications for public finances, into a context of intergenerational 
disparities – documenting the diverging income and wealth trajectories 
across the generations and the implications for poverty among different 
cohorts. Possible complementary avenues for offsetting the negative 
growth effect of demographic change are considered and their potential 
quantified based on alternative simulation scenarios.

change, economic growth and 
intergenerational inequalities

In Brief 
Key findings 
Opposite trends in fertility and life expectancy, and the progressive exit of baby boomers from the labour 
force, have already increased OECD countries old-age dependency ratio – defined as the ratio of the 
seniors (aged 65 years and above) to the working-age population – and will increasingly do so in the 
coming decades. In turn, without further policy action and changes in behaviours (e.g. people living 
longer may be able and willing to stay in the labour force for longer), this will drag down significantly 
economic growth and the capacity of OECD countries to improve their living standards. 
This chapter sets the scene for the thematic part of this OECD Employment Outlook 2025, which is 
devoted to ageing and the labour market. It presents projection scenarios quantifying the impact of 
demographic change on GDP per capita growth. It also discusses current trends in intergenerational 
inequalities in incomes and wealth and their implications in terms of fairness of alternative policy 
solutions. 
The key findings are as follows: 
• 
In the coming years, the size of the working-age population (aged 20-64 years) will decline 
in a large number of OECD countries, while the old-age dependency ratio will continue to 
soar. By 2060, the working-age population will have declined by 8% in the OECD area, and by 
more than 30% in more than a quarter of OECD countries. The OECD old-age dependency ratio 
increased from 19% in 1980 to 31% in 2023 and is projected to rise further to 52% by 2060. 
• 
Because of population ageing, the employment-to-population ratio – that is, the percentage 
share of employed persons in the total population – is projected to decrease by 
1.9 percentage points by 2060 in the OECD area. In Spain and the Slovak Republic, the slump 
is expected to be of 10 percentage points. 
• 
Assuming constant growth rate of labour productivity (GDP per person employed) and labour 
market entry and exit rate for the various groups, the projected contraction of the share of 
employed persons in total population implies that GDP per capita growth in the OECD area 
will be reduced by about 40%, falling from 1.0% per year in the 2010s to 0.6% per year on 
average over the period 2024-60. This corresponds to 14% of foregone GDP per capita by 2060. 
In the absence of policy action, almost all OECD countries will see their GDP per capita growth 
declining. 
• 
While there are large differences in fertility rates across OECD countries and policies can 
contribute to contain their decline if not reverse it, changes in fertility trends can do little to 
counteract population ageing especially in the short term. Providing family policies that help 
the reconciliation of work and family life but also reduce the costs of raising children, especially 
housing costs, are key factors. However, because of changes in preferences for children, it is 
unlikely that such policies will enable countries to revert significantly trend decline in fertility 
rates. And in any event the growth dividend of higher fertility would materialise only in several 
decades. 
• 
Labour productivity growth has been on a declining trend for many decades. 
Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation have made some scholars optimistic 
about the possibility of significantly reviving it but it is unclear whether even such a boost will be 

--- Page Break ---
   69 
 
OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
enough alone to bring productivity growth to the levels needed to compensate for the decline of 
labour input. While appropriate structural reforms to improve productivity can 
unambiguously be part of the solution, mobilising untapped labour resources will be key 
to maintain GDP per capita growth. 
• 
Migration can contribute to lessen the challenge demographic ageing poses to economic 
growth, and is already doing so. However, its potential does not appear a game changer 
unless net migration rates increase well above historical values. By increasing net 
migration rates to the 75th percentile of the cross-country distribution in 2021-24, the median 
OECD country could improve its GDP per capita growth by 0.13 percentage points with respect 
to a hypothetical no migration scenario in which net migration flows are set to zero. 
• 
Closing the employment gap between men and women of all ages would deliver 
significant growth dividends: keeping all other assumptions as in the baseline scenario, it 
could increase annual OECD GDP per capita growth by 0.2 percentage points with respect to 
the baseline scenario, and by up to 0.6 percentage points in countries currently characterised 
by low female labour force participation. More than one-third of these potential gains, however, 
would come from closing the gender gap for older workers (aged 55 years or more). Additional 
gains may be achieved by closing the gender gap in hours worked. Yet, care must be taken to 
ensure that all this goes hand in hand with closing the gender gap in unpaid work. 
• 
Mobilising further labour market participation and employment of older people in good 
health has a significant growth potential. By reducing the employment exit rate of older 
people to that of the best 10% of OECD countries, about half of the OECD countries could gain 
at least 0.2 percentage points of annual GDP per capita growth with respect to the baseline 
scenario. Adding the effect of closing the gender employment gap at older ages, the gain in 
annual GDP per capita growth for the whole OECD could reach 0.26 percentage points, twice 
as much as the gain from closing the gender employment gap for young and prime-age people. 
• 
Overall, all these avenues to mobilise untapped labour resources should be considered as 
part of the solution to the growth challenges posed by population ageing. Yet, significant 
investments and costly policy actions are required to make them work. Nonetheless, even 
mobilising these untapped resources to reach two-thirds of the above-mentioned, very ambitious 
potentials in all these dimensions would allow cushioning 70% of the annual loss in GDP per 
capita growth due to demographic change as projected in the baseline scenario for the period 
2024-60, reaching a projected annual GDP per capita growth of 0.9%. This rate could be further 
increased with appropriate policies to revive productivity growth. 
• 
Failing to mobilise under-represented groups and in particular older workers in good 
health will not only lead to a significant reduction in GDP per capita growth but would also imply 
shifting the burden onto younger cohorts, as a smaller working-age labour pool will have to 
produce more just to maintain living standards of a larger dependent population. This would 
raise serious fairness issues as intergenerational inequalities have already progressed 
in favour of older generations in past decades: 
o 
Older generations (both 55-64 year-olds and 65+ year-olds) have benefited from higher 
income growth than the young (aged 25 to 34) in most OECD countries since the mid-1990s, 
and the poverty risk has shifted away from older people towards children. 
o 
Intergenerational disparities in household wealth are large, as older generations have 
benefited from booming asset markets, and in particular rising house prices. Meanwhile, 
younger cohorts face barriers to wealth accumulation, and homeownership is increasingly 
out of reach for many.

A large share of public social spending is devoted to seniors in the form of pensions and 
health expenditures, and this part will continue to grow as populations continue to age and 
live longer.

The next two thematic chapters delve deeper into the challenges of, and perspectives for, 
mobilising labour resources at older age while making careers longer and more successful 
(Chapters 3 and 4). Chapter 4 also discusses the link between skills and individual productivity. 
Finally, Chapter 5 analyses the effect of job mobility and labour reallocation on productivity 
growth and discusses the potential implications that an ageing workforce, associated with lower 
job-to-job mobility, could have on productivity growth trends. 
Introduction 
The world is changing fast. Several megatrends, such as digitalisation, climate change and population 
ageing, are transforming the world we live in and are having a deep impact on our lives, cultures, societies 
and living standards. The world of work will be at the forefront of these transformations and their impacts. 
It will have to adapt to these trends, seizing the opportunities they bring and addressing the challenges. 
While digitalisation (including its latest developments with generative artificial intelligence – AI hereafter) 
and mitigation of, and adaptation to, the effects of climate change have been widely analysed in previous 
editions of the OECD Employment Outlook – see e.g. OECD (2019[1]; 2023[2]; 2024[3]), the demographic 
transition and its consequences for the labour market have generally received less attention in recent years 
in this publication series. This edition of the OECD Employment Outlook aims to fill this gap. 
In all OECD countries, declining fertility and increasing life expectancy have thrust population ageing to 
the forefront of the agenda – see e.g. OECD (2023[4]; 2024[5]). On the one hand, demographic change, and 
the progressive exit of baby boomers from the labour market, is turning the contribution of labour input to 
economic growth from positive to negative in almost all OECD countries. Widespread labour shortages in 
all sectors and occupations – see OECD (2023[2]; 2024[3]; 2024[6]) and Chapter 1 – are, partially, the salient 
symptom of this structural change. And this occurs after decades of declining productivity growth in the 
OECD area. On the other hand, ageing populations tend to increase demand for support and spending on 
health, long-term care, and pensions, and will continue to do so in the future. Absent policy action, 
increasing demands from a large, and in some cases expanding, consumer pool1 will have to be satisfied 
by the production of a shrinking labour pool, challenging living standards and even societal cohesion. 
The remainder of this Outlook will focus on the consequences of demographic change for the economy 
and the labour market, and how the labour market can be part of the solution. This chapter aims at setting 
the scene by discussing the impact of demographic change on economic growth and intergenerational 
inequality. It is divided as follows. Section 2.1 describes key demographic trends. Section 2.2 presents a 
simple baseline projection scenario to describe the likely consequences of demographic change on 
economic growth without further policy action. Section 2.3. considers various simulation scenarios enabling 
a quantification of the potential of different labour market channels that could help mitigate or even fully 
offset these consequences. Section 2.4 focuses on trends in intergenerational inequalities and shows that 
income and wealth trajectories of older and younger generations have followed divergent patterns. 
Section 2.5 concludes and presents a roadmap of the remainder of the book. 
The overarching conclusion of the chapter is that maintaining current growth rates cannot be achieved 
without a significant mobilisation of the employment potential of all under-represented groups. Any other 
strategy aiming at coping with the reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth brought 
about by population ageing risks falling short of the target and bringing about significant implications for 
fairness, as older cohorts have been increasingly better off in recent years as compared to younger

generations. The chapter is followed by three thematic chapters delving deeper into challenges of, and 
perspectives for, mobilising labour resources at older age while making longer careers more successful 
and ensuring that older workers in good health can thrive in the labour market. 
2.1. Population ageing: Past and future trends 
People in OECD countries live longer and in better health than before. For the OECD area, longevity has 
steadily increased since the end of World War II (WW II), with the temporary exception of the years of the 
COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 2.1). Since 1950, life expectancy at birth has gained 20 years, most of which 
in good health (OECD, 2017[7]; 2020[8]), even though the gap between life expectancy and health-adjusted 
life expectancy has increased in a number of OECD countries in recent years (Garmany and Terzic, 
2024[9]; OECD/European Commission, 2024[10]). Even in recent years, however, the increase in healthy 
life expectancy at age 60 years represents 70% of the overall increase in life expectancy at age 60 (see 
Box 2.1). All these are significant achievements. At the same time, however, fertility rates, in 
OECD countries, which rose after the end of World War II and remained high until the 1960s, have 
plummeted since then. The total fertility rate (i.e. the average number of live births a woman would have 
by age 50 if she were subject, throughout her life, to the age-specific fertility rates observed in a given 
year) for the OECD area has collapsed from about 3.4 until the mid-1960s to 1.5 in recent years, although 
large differences across countries remain – in 2023, total fertility rates in OECD countries ranged between 
0.7 in Korea and 2.8 in Israel. According to the medium scenario of the UN population projections (United 
Nations, 2024[11]), fertility rates may stabilise in the future, while life expectancy will continue to increase, 
albeit at a slower pace (Figure 2.1).2

Box 2.1. Recent increase in healthy life expectancy 
OECD citizens are not only living longer but also enjoying more years in good health. On average, in 
2021, a 60-year-old individual can expect to live 23 years more, with 17.3 of those years being spent in 
full health – see also OECD/European Commission (2024[10]). This represents an increase in life 
expectancy at age 60 of 1.7 years, relatively to 2000, with 70% of these gains corresponding to 
increases in healthy life expectancy(Figure 2.2), defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as 
the number of years expected to live in full health – i.e. excluding years of life expectancy burdened by 
disease or injury.

Fertility trends imply that the relatively large cohorts born in the two decades after WW II have been 
continuously replaced, in recent years, by increasingly smaller cohorts entering the labour market. As baby 
boomers exit the labour market, the working-age population (defined as those aged from 20 to 64 years) 
has started declining or will start declining soon in the majority of OECD countries (Figure 2.3). Overall, 
the working-age population in the OECD area is projected to decline by 8% between 2023 and 2060. But 
in one-quarter of OECD countries, including many Eastern Asian and Southern, Central and Eastern 
European countries, it is projected to fall by more than 30% – and by up to 46% in Korea. Very high rates 
of decline of the working-age population are also projected in four “accession” countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, 
Romania and Thailand) and China. By contrast, in a few OECD countries, the working-age population is 
still projected to increase, especially in Australia and Canada, where net migration rates are projected to 
be high (see Section 2.3.2 below), and Israel and Mexico, where age pyramids have still a broad base as 
fertility is still high or has declined below replacement levels3 only recently.

Decreasing fertility and increasing longevity also brought about a fundamental change in the age structure 
of the population. The share of older individuals (aged 55-64 years) within the OECD working-age 
population increased by about 50% between 1980 and 2023, although in most countries it is not projected 
to increase much further in the next quarter of century (Figure 2.4). By contrast, the old-age population has 
grown dramatically and will continue to do so. Consequently, the share of the seniors (aged 65 years and 
above) in the population has soared and is projected to increase further at a faster pace. In the OECD 
area, the old-age dependency ratio, defined as the ratio of the seniors to the working-age population, 
increased from 19% in 1980 to 31% in 2023 and is projected to increase further to 52% by 2060 
(Figure 2.5).4 By then, it will be above 50% in 30 OECD countries, and above 75% in Italy, Japan, Poland, 
Spain and Korea. In the latter country, UN projections suggest that in 2060 the overall dependency ratio 
(including also children in the numerator) will surpass 100%,5 and it will reach 70% in the OECD area as 
a whole. 
Although there is significant uncertainty about population projections (especially regarding fertility rates), 
UN projections still forecast, with a probability of at least 90% in all countries except Israel, a significant 
increase of the old-age dependency ratio by 2060 (see Annex Figure 2.A.1).6 Absent policy action or 
changes in individual behaviour – for example because people living longer in good health may wish to 
stay in the labour force and remain employed for longer, see e.g. IMF (2025[12]) – this shift in the population 
structure will imply that an increasingly small labour pool will have to generate income for an increasingly 
large pool of people consuming but not producing, weighing heavily on the capacity of countries to continue 
to improve their living standards. The next section will delve more deeply into this type of accounting.

2.2. Population ageing and economic growth 
The decline of the working-age population and the increase of the old-age dependency ratio pose a 
significant challenge to maintaining OECD countries’ GDP per capita growth. While living standards are 
better measured through either the OECD better life index or gross national income per capita, due to 
measurement and forecasting issues this chapter limits the discussion to GDP per capita growth, which is 
a key determinant of material living standard (see Box 2.2). 
Box 2.2. Living standards, GDP per capita levels and growth 
The concept of a country’s living standards typically captures average well-being in that country. At 
the country level, living standards are typically assessed through a measure of aggregate well-being 
such as the OECD Better Life Index (BLI hereafter) and its sub-indicators – see OECD (2011[13]; 
2024[14]). The BLI is a synthetic index that aggregates several indicators capturing multiple dimensions 
of material living standards (income, wealth, jobs, earnings and housing) and quality of life (health, 
combining work and life, education and skills, social connections, civil engagement and governance, 
environmental quality, personal security, and perceived well-being). 
By contrast, GDP measures the output produced domestically and GDP per capita standardises GDP 
by dividing it with the total population. Although it is widely used for its availability, it is a relatively 
imprecise proxy for the gross income of domestic households. Notably, GDP per capita includes income 
paid to non-residents and excludes residents’ income from production in other countries. Moreover, it 
does not incorporate other aspects of well-being that are not directly dependent on income, and only 
partially integrates information on how the various types of capital that sustain well-being are changing 
over time (OECD, 2011[13]). Yet, the growth rate of GDP per capita strongly correlates with the growth 
rate of real gross disposable income per capita of households and non-profit institutions serving 
households, a key component of any indicator of material living standards. For example, the 
correlation of these two growth rates between 2007 and 2022, across the OECD countries for which 
data are available, is 0.62, and increases to 0.87 upon exclusion of Ireland, a clear outlier in the 
relationship (Annex Figure 2.A.2, Panel A). The main reason for this result is that what is produced 
domestically remains, in most OECD countries, the main determinant of domestic household income. 
GDP per capita growth also correlates with changes in the aggregate BLI. For example, the cross-
country correlation of the growth rate of GDP per capita and changes in the BLI between 2010 and 
2023 is mildly positive (0.22) but soars to 0.55 when Ireland and Türkiye, two clear outliers where GDP 
per capita growth outpaced progress in the BLI, are excluded (Annex Figure 2.A.2, Panel B). Overall, 
this suggests that GDP per capita growth projections can be informative, albeit imperfectly, as regards 
the possible future evolution of living standards, and in particular material living standards. 
In the context of population ageing, however, projected GDP per capita growth will likely overestimate 
the potential change in living standards. Indeed, as discussed in Section 2.4, given current policies, 
population ageing implies that an increasingly larger share of GDP will be spent on health and pensions 
just to maintain living standards among the older population. A positive, but low GDP per capita growth 
may be insufficient to generate sufficient additional resources to improve living standards among the 
whole population. 
Trends in the dependency ratio will have a direct impact on GDP per capita, which is the product of 
aggregate GDP per person employed, and the share of employed persons in the total population 
(employment-to-population ratio). In turn, the latter is equal to the product of the employment rate (the ratio 
of employment to working-age population) and the share of the working-age population in total population.7 
While it can be expected that the replacement of older cohorts with younger cohorts with stronger labour

market attachment8 will somewhat increase the aggregate employment rate of people of working age, the 
share of the working-age population in total population will shrink dramatically, as shown in the previous 
section. In turn, this will significantly depress the trend of the employment-to-population ratio and, 
therefore, of GDP per capita growth – see also André, Gal and Schief (2024[15]). 
Figure 2.6 shows the projected reductions of the ratio of employment to population, disaggregated into the 
contributions from the two channels outlined above – namely, the changes in the share of the working-age 
population in total population (population structure channel) and the changes by cohorts in the age-specific 
employment rate (cohort replacement channel). The effect of the latter partially offsets that of the former 
due to the stronger labour market attachment of younger cohorts throughout their career. Age- and gender-
specific employment rate projections assume constant labour market entry and exit rates for each group 
and are drawn from Fluchtmann, Keese and Adema (2024[16])9 and then combined with the medium 
scenario of UN population projections, used in the previous section.

as new cohorts replace older cohorts. OECD: Weighted average of OECD countries.

Because of population ageing, the percentage share of employed persons in the OECD total population 
(employment-to-population ratio) is projected to decrease from 48.1% in 2023 to 46.2% in 2060, that is by 
1.9 percentage points. This share will decline in all but three OECD countries (Israel, Mexico and Türkiye) 
but the fall is projected to be particularly large (more than 10 percentage points) in the Slovak Republic 
and Spain. Yet, the replacement of older with younger (usually more active) cohorts is expected to 
attenuate this reduction in many countries. Projections suggest that the drop of the employment-to-

population ratio would be 1.6 percentage points larger, on average, if younger cohorts did not have 
stronger labour market attachment than older cohorts. With few exceptions,10 the replacement of older 
cohorts with younger cohorts indeed implies an increase in the employment rate of people of working age. 
However, this is usually insufficient to fully compensate for the effect of the change in the structure of the 
population, and especially the expansion of jobless old-age population, which remains the most important 
factor driving the (negative) dynamics of the share of employed persons in the population in almost all 
countries, except Colombia and Türkiye. 
Under the assumption that the growth rate of labour productivity (GDP per person employed) remains 
approximately constant,11 the contraction of the employment-to-population ratio, in percentage terms, 
translates into an equal percentage effect on GDP per capita. In particular, setting the productivity growth 
rate in the next quarter of century at the level observed in 2006-19,12 the baseline scenario suggests that 
GDP per capita growth in the OECD area will be reduced by about 40%, falling from 1.0% per year in 
2006-19 to an average of 0.6% per year in the period 2024-60 (Figure 2.7).13 In other words, by 2060, 
GDP per capita in the OECD will be 14% lower than what would occur if labour input continued to grow at 
the same rate as during the previous business cycle.

Without a pick-up in employment and productivity trends beyond baseline projections, almost all 
OECD countries will see their annual growth declining due to population ageing. This is because historical 
employment trends, including in recent years, have always been such that the labour input has provided a 
positive contribution to average GDP per capita growth. By contrast, current trends in population ageing imply

that, in per capita terms, the contribution of the labour input will turn negative in all OECD countries except 
Israel, Türkiye and Mexico, as seen in Figure 2.6 above. Expected annual GDP per capita growth will remain 
about constant in Ireland and the United States and decline by 0.25 percentage points or less in Denmark, 
France and Portugal. In all these countries, however, it can be argued that the comparatively small decline 
is, by and large, due to an already limited contribution of the labour input to growth in recent years, as shown 
by the small difference between the rates of growth of GDP per capita and GDP per worker in the 2010s. At 
the other side of the spectrum, many Central and Eastern European countries as well as Chile, Colombia, 
Korea and Luxembourg will see their growth rate contracting by at least 1 percentage point, although 
declining from very high rates in all these countries, except Austria, Germany and Luxembourg. In all these 
countries, if the employment-to-population ratio continued to grow at the same rate as before, GDP per capita 
would be at least 30% higher in 2060 than what forecasted by the baseline projections. Largely because of 
the negative productivity growth observed in recent years and used as a benchmark, annual growth of GDP 
per capita is estimated to be significantly negative in Greece, Italy and Luxembourg (below -0.5%), A slightly 
negative average annual growth of GDP per capita is also projected in Austria and Norway.14 
2.3. Potential gains from mobilising untapped labour resources 
The analysis of the previous sections suggests that, in the short and medium term, most OECD countries 
will face an unprecedented collapse of GDP per capita growth, which can be avoided only through bold 
policy action. This will require operating on several levers, which will be examined in this section. 
2.3.1. Is a sufficient recovery in productivity growth in sight? 
A key objective in all OECD countries is to revive growth of GDP per person employed, which has declined 
since the last decade of the 20th century in almost all of them (Annex Figure 2.A.3). GDP per person 
employed, however, is the product of hours worked per worker and hourly labour productivity (GDP per 
hour worked). Hours worked per worker in OECD countries are on a historically declining path, even though 
their fall has slowed down somewhat in recent years – see e.g. OECD (2021[17]; 2022[18]). Total hours per 
worker have declined since 2005 in almost all OECD countries for which data are available, for an average 
reduction of 5.5% – see Chapter 1. Because of these historical trends, significantly increasing hours 
worked by the average person may therefore be out of reach and their level can at best be expected to 
stabilise in the near future.15 
Hourly labour productivity growth has also been on a declining trend for many years – see 
e.g. OECD (2024[19]) and Chapter 5.16 Yet, the diffusion of generative AI as a new general-purpose 
technology and the deepening of automation – see OECD (2023[2]) – have made many scholars optimistic 
about the possibility of significantly reviving hourly productivity growth in the same way as the diffusion of 
digital technologies in the 1990s eventually led to a recovery of hourly productivity growth for almost a 
couple of decades in a few countries – see e.g. Brynjolfsson and Mitchell (2017[20]); Aghion, Jones and 
Jones (2017[21]); Lu (2021[22]); Baily, Brynjolfsson and Korinek (2023[23]); Filippucci et al. (2024[24]); 
OECD (2024[25]); and Committee on Automation and the US Workforce (2024[26]).17 Additionally, ageing-
driven increases in aggregate saving can lead to greater capital deepening thereby boosting labour 
productivity (see Box 2.3). Yet, in many other OECD countries, especially in Asia and continental Europe, 
the diffusion of digital technologies of the 1990s did not halt the secular decline in hourly productivity 
growth, which continued to fall more or less steadily – see e.g. Fernald, Inklaar and Ruzic (2024[27]) and 
OECD (2024[19]). And while in the 1990s OECD countries’ hourly productivity growth was also benefitting 
from the large expansion of trade and global value chains – see e.g. Grossman and Rossi-
Hansberg (2008[28]); Baldwin (2012[29]); Criscuolo and Timmis (2018[30]); and OECD (2019[1]), this push is 
unlikely to be repeatable today, especially on such a large scale (Constantinescu, Mattoo and Ruta, 
2016[31]; Goldin et al., 2024[32]). Moreover, other factors, including the acceleration of climate change, could

additionally exert a negative pressure on productivity growth in the future – for example, in a recent paper, 
Bilal and Känzig (2024[33]) estimate that world GDP per capita would already be 37% higher today had no 
warming occurred since 1960, which implies an average drag on world hourly productivity growth of about 
0.5 percentage points per year. This drag is likely to increase in the near future, especially if insufficient 
policy action is taken to counter climate change – see OECD (2024[3]). There is also some concern that an 
ageing labour force could dampen hourly productivity growth, although the literature on the aggregate 
effect of ageing on productivity growth is nuanced – see Box 2.3 and Chapters 4 and 5. For all these 
reasons, nevertheless, it is unlikely that labour productivity growth could be revived at a level which, alone, 
would suffice to compensate the projected decline in GDP per capita growth. 
Box 2.3. How does ageing affect productivity growth? 
Ageing can affect labour productivity through multiple pathways, with no clear consensus on the 
direction and magnitude of its impact. Understanding this complex causal relationship requires zooming 
in on each of those potential pathways, ranging from micro, worker and firm-level ageing effects to 
broader macro impacts of aged societies on aggregate demand and public and private investment 
(André, Gal and Schief, 2024[15]). 
The impact of individual ageing on the worker’s productivity remains ambiguous. While individual hourly 
productivity declines at some point in people’s lives, this point is likely to depend on multiple factors, 
including individual characteristics (including health and education), type of occupation (see also 
Chapter 4), and workplace organisation (see also Chapter 3). For many workers, the tipping point could 
be at relatively old age. Indeed, even if physical strength and cognitive skills, including learning capacity, 
deteriorate during the working life – see e.g. Prskawetz and Lindh (2006[34]) and Chapter 4 – especially 
when such capabilities are not regularly used (Hanushek et al., 2025[35]), older workers often take on 
different tasks than their younger colleagues, such as managerial roles (National Research Council, 
2012[36]), and likely rely on different skill sets. Thus, firms’ ability to harness skill complementarities 
across an age-diverse workforce is a key determinant of older workers’ productivity (OECD, 2020[8]). 
Ageing societies may experience a less dynamic business environment, both in terms of firm entry and 
exit rates, and a concentration of aggregate demand in less productive sectors, potentially dragging 
down overall productivity growth. Entrepreneurship quality may decrease as decision-making positions 
are increasingly occupied by older individuals, preventing younger workers from gaining sufficient 
experience by the mid-40s, the typical age to start a successful business (Azoulay et al., 2020[37]). 
Incumbent firms may also face less pressure from new competitors and products, as ageing consumers 
crystalise consumption patterns (Bornstein, 2021[38]). At the same time, demographic ageing can tilt 
demand towards activities characterised by lower productivity growth, particularly long-term care 
services (Baumol, 1993[39]; Cravino, Levchenko and Rojas, 2022[40]). 
Ageing is also likely to reshape the allocation of inputs and investment decisions in both the private and 
public sectors, with opposite effects on productivity growth. An ageing workforce tends to be less mobile 
between jobs, reducing the efficiency of the matching process, thereby significantly depressing 
productivity growth through the reallocation channel (see Chapter 5) and potentially contributing to labour 
shortages. However, these shortages can also create incentives to invest in labour-saving and labour-
replacing technologies (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017[41]; 2021[42]). Moreover, ageing-driven increases in 
aggregate saving can lead to greater capital deepening thereby boosting labour productivity, under the 
condition that real interest rates can adjust downwards to absorb excess savings (Eggertsson, Lancastre 
and Summers, 2019[43]). On the contrary, rising public and private social expenditures associated with 
ageing (see Section 2.4) may reduce saving and crowd out productive private investments. 
Ultimately, these opposing forces make it difficult to predict which effects will dominate, leaving the net 
impact of ageing on productivity growth ambiguous.

2.3.2. Complementary scenarios for mobilising untapped labour resources 
Mobilising untapped labour resources appears therefore a necessary complementary strategy. The origin 
of the decline in labour input can be traced back to the secular decline in fertility rates (see Section 2.1). 
However, as briefly discussed in Box 2.4, while fertility policies can contribute to contain the decline in 
fertility rates, it is unlikely that such policies will enable countries to revert significantly the trend in 
population ageing, because of changes in preferences for having children. Moreover, in the next quarter 
of century, raising the fertility rate will mechanically increase the denominator of GDP per capita without 
significantly increasing the numerator, with a negative effect on per capita growth.  
Box 2.4. What role do policies play in sustaining fertility rates? 
Actions that reduce the opportunity cost of rearing children, such as providing affordable childcare and 
strengthening work-life balance policies could serve the dual purpose of closing the gender gap in 
labour market participation and increasing fertility. In fact, from the 1980s onwards, women’s 
employment rates are positively associated with higher total fertility rates across the OECD 
(Fluchtmann, van Veen and Adema, 2023[44]). Similarly, expenditure on parental leaves, family 
allowances, housing, and early childhood education and care policies positively correlates with fertility. 
However, labour market, housing, education and family policies can only partially explain the evolution 
of fertility rates (Fluchtmann, van Veen and Adema, 2023[44]), which could point to the role of other 
factors such as financial insecurity, societal attitudes and norms (OECD, 2024[5]). 
To better capture the full picture, it is indeed necessary to search for other drivers of fertility trends. 
Culture, social norms, and attitudes towards childbearing are natural candidates (Fernández and Fogli, 
2009[45]; Newson and Richerson, 2009[46]). The ascension of individual self-fulfilment as an alternative 
life goal to family formation (Sobotka, 2008[47]), coupled with increasingly higher standards of parental 
roles, increase the implicit cost of childrearing (OECD, 2024[5]), which adds up to the higher costs of 
housing and, in some countries, education, both post-compulsory and to support children of school age 
through private tutoring. Such mounting implicit costs can in turn influence parents to delay entering 
parenthood (Gustafsson, 2001[48]), have fewer children (Becker, 1960[49]), or opt for having no children 
at all (Baudin, de la Croix and Gobbi, 2015[50]). Given the potentially slow and even intergenerational 
effort required to transform social norms, attitudes, or preferences (Bisin and Verdier, 2000[51]), it is 
unlikely that policy will swiftly boost fertility through these channels. 
Summing up, public policy does play a role in explaining at least partially cross-country differences in 
fertility rates, despite the generalised trend decline, but it cannot be expected that even best policy 
practices will revert fertility rates back to replacement levels. Even if they could succeed, higher birth 
rates today will materialise into larger working-age cohorts no earlier than 20-25 years from now. During 
that time, rising child dependency ratios would add to the already growing old-age dependency, 
meaning that until the mid-2050s, new cohorts will add much more to the denominator than to the 
numerator of GDP per capita. Since their contribution to the size of the working-age population will 
remain small in subsequent years, a gradual increase in fertility rates to replacement levels by 2035 
(almost certainly an overoptimistic perspective given recent trends), would at best have little impact on 
GDP per capita by 2060. 
Three more promising sources of labour resources will be considered in this section. They include: 
i) increasing employment and labour force participation of the older people in good health; ii) closing the 
gender gap in employment; and iii) sustaining net migration, including by better attracting talent, making 
the most of migrants’ skills and reducing brain drain (in countries where this is relevant).

Another source of labour resources that is not modelled here but is likely to play a role in countries with 
high rates of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET)18 is raising youth employment. 
Nonetheless, to ensure that young workers are equipped with the skills required to navigate the labour 
market during their whole career, effectively reducing NEET rates often entails improving education 
services and reducing school dropouts and/or offering full-time, second-chance educational programmes, 
like the US Job Corps programme, without necessarily having a significant impact on aggregate 
employment rates in those age categories – see e.g. Schochet, Burghardt and McConnell (2006[52]); 
Cohen and Piquero (2015[53]); and OECD (2018[54]; 2023[55]).19 
Migration contributes to lessen the challenge posed by demographic change to GDP per 
capita growth 
Regular migrants are already contributing to sustaining working-age population, and, in the baseline 
scenario, are projected to continue to do so in the future, although projected net migration rates20 in the 
UN medium scenario are lower than those observed in the most recent available data in many countries – 
2021-24, see Annex Figure 2.A.4.21 Yet, translating the contribution of migration flows to the population in 
the host country into their contribution to employment-to-population ratios is not a trivial task. On the one 
hand, in some countries, labour force participation and employment rates of the foreign-born are lower 
than those of the native-born, especially soon after their arrival in the host country (OECD, 2024[56]). 
Multiple factors contribute to this pattern, including, inter alia, migration reasons (work, humanitarian, 
family, study, etc…), socio-economic status, and the fact that migrants often do not have the competences 
in demand in host countries (Spielvogel and Meghnagi, 2018[57])22 and, at least at the beginning, may lack 
the experience – including language skills – to effectively navigate the host country’s labour 
market (OECD, 2023[58]). On the other hand, foreign-born are over-represented among the self-employed, 
and migrant entrepreneurs significantly contribute to job creation in host countries (OECD, 2024[56]). 
Moreover, migrants play a key role in reducing labour shortages in certain sectors, such as long-term care 
– see e.g. Rapp and Sicsic (2020[59]); Grabowski, Gruber and McGarry (2023[60]); Jun and Grabowski 
(2024[61]) and OECD (forthcoming[62]). 
Due to data limitations, however, for the purpose of the simple simulation exercise presented in this 
chapter, observed employment rate gaps between native-born and foreign-born by gender are taken as 
starting points. The projected percentage changes of employment rates of the foreign-born are then 
assumed to be the same as those of natives in the same gender and age category – that is, the computed 
2023 employment rate gap in each category is assumed to be constant in subsequent years. These 
limitations require some caution in drawing conclusions from the results.23 
As shown in Figure 2.8, should migration flows be slowed down in the near future so that to set net 
migration rates to zero (zero-migration scenario), projected GDP per capita growth would fall additionally 
by 0.06 percentage points per year in the OECD with respect to the baseline scenario (presented in 
Section 2.2 above), in which net migration rates are set as in the UN medium scenario (see Annex 
Figure 2.A.4). The decline would be greater than 0.15 percentage points only in Canada and Luxembourg, 
where this relatively large effect is essentially due to relatively large net migration rates forecasted in the 
UN medium scenario in these countries. In other countries, such as Denmark, France, Portugal, Spain and 
the United Kingdom, even if setting net migration to zero would have only a small impact on growth in 
absolute terms, these additional losses would still increase the projected loss in GDP per capita growth 
entailed by the baseline scenario by more than 20%. On the other side of the spectrum, countries that are 
projected to have, on average, negative net migration rates due to significant emigration – Mexico, Türkiye 
and some Central and Eastern European countries – would potentially benefit from a zero-migration world, 
but the projected effect would remain small.

As already noted, however, net migration rates included in the baseline scenario (based on the UN medium 
scenario) are lower than historical rates in many countries. For OECD countries, the cross-country median 
of annual net migration rates in recent years was 0.46% in 2021-24 and 0.37% in 2016-20 against an 
average cross-country median of UN projected rates of 0.24% for 2024-60 in the baseline scenario. Median 
net migration rates have also trended up steadily since at least 1990 (United Nations, 2024[63]) and inflows 
of foreign-born have never been so high (OECD, 2024[56]). Figure 2.8 considers therefore two higher 
migration scenarios, which might better help characterise the potential of the migration channel: a 
moderately high scenario, in which net migration rates are set to increase to the median levels of the 
2021-24 cross-country distribution (0.46%) in all countries by 2030 (and remain constant thereafter), 
except if the baseline projection is higher; and a high migration scenario, in which net migration rates are 
set to increase to the 75th percentile of the cross-country distribution (0.61%), again in all countries by 2030 
except if the baseline projection is higher.24 It must be noted, however, that, while in the baseline and the 
zero migration scenarios all world flows are balanced, in the high and moderately high migration scenarios

this is not the case since the same net migration rate target is used for all the countries. These two 
scenarios, therefore, only allow simulating the potential gains from migration separately for each country. 
Potential gains from higher regular migration in terms of GDP per capita growth appear to be particularly 
high in many Southern, Central and Eastern European countries, where they could exceed 0.1 percentage 
points per year in the moderately high migration scenario and 0.2 percentage points in the high migration 
scenario (Figure 2.8). Overall, compared with a world without migration (zero-migration scenario), by 
reaching a net migration rate of 0.61% by 2030, the median OECD country could improve its GDP per 
capita growth by 0.13 percentage points,25 and up to 0.25 percentage points in Greece, Italy, Luxembourg 
and Slovenia. By contrast, gains from migration appear close to zero in countries such as the Netherlands, 
Israel and Mexico, due to either the projected composition of immigration flows (larger for groups with no 
or limited labour market participation – Israel) and/or the much lower current participation of migrants to 
the labour market – Mexico and the Netherlands, see OECD (2024[56]). In particular, the latter factor is 
likely to lead to an underestimation of the growth potential of the high migration scenarios, since 
employment rates of migrants would improve if increasing net migration flows are accompanied by more 
selective migration policies tuned towards labour market needs of the host country. 
Overall, while regular migration can contribute to lessen the challenge demographic ageing poses to living 
standards, its potential does not appear a game changer unless net migration rates increase well above 
the historically high rates observed in recent years. Yet, the higher the sudden increase in net migration 
flows, the larger the policy interventions required to integrate higher migrant inflows into the labour market 
– see e.g. OECD (2016[64]; 2017[65]; 2017[66]; 2021[67]; 2023[58]). Needed interventions may range across 
very broad areas, for example from introduction measures, language training and specialised training 
(including in origin countries) to providing affordable transport and housing – see also Hermans 
et al. (2020[68]). Ensuring adequate access to these services is an unavoidable, integral part of well-
managed migration and integration policies, but these interventions are costly and difficult to provide at 
scale (OECD, 2024[56]). Moreover, most migrants remain only temporarily in the host country, making it 
even more difficult to sustain high net migration rates over time (OECD, 2024[56]). And effectively increasing 
net migration rates in a way matching host countries skill needs might require retaining or reattracting 
native-born citizens, and more generally, competing effectively to attract talent (Spielvogel and Meghnagi, 
2018[57]; d’Aiglepierre et al., 2020[69]; Beine, Peri and Raux, 2023[70]). Last but not least, host countries’ 
populations are often not ready to accept large increases in foreign-born inflows, even when these could 
bring clear economic gains, and attempts to raise them significantly may generate strong political 
backlash (Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2014[71]; McCann, Sienkiewicz and Zard, 2023[72]; Boeri et al., 
2024[73]), especially when flows have a strong low-skilled component (Moriconi, Peri and Turati, 2022[74]; 
Docquier and Rapoport, 2025[75]). 
Closing the gender gap in employment can deliver large growth dividends 
Reducing the employment gap between men and women of working age appears to have a clear potential. 
In all OECD countries, women have lower employment rates than men of the same age, and even if gender 
gaps in employment rates have continued to narrow in recent years, the pace of convergence has slowed 
down. The gender gap in employment rates of people of working age fell by 7.6 percentage points between 
2000 and 2021, but its fall halved in the second decade of the 21st century (OECD, 2023[76])) and OECD 
evidence suggests that, in recent years, female employment has progressed significantly only in countries 
with the largest gender gap in employment (OECD, 2024[3]), although this progress is decelerating (see 
Chapter 1). Overall, this suggests that considerable progress can still be made in closing the gender gap 
in most countries, and that it could bring significant growth dividends. 
Closing the gender employment gap between men and women of all ages in all OECD countries, while 
keeping all other assumptions as in the baseline scenario, could increase annual OECD GDP per capita 
growth by 0.2 percentage points (Figure 2.9).26 In countries where female labour force participation is

particularly low (Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Greece, Italy and Türkiye), the simulation suggests that 
closing the gender gap could increase GDP per capita by 0.3 percentage points or more and up to 
0.6 percentage points in Colombia. The contribution of closing the gender gap to GDP per capita growth 
would instead remain modest in countries where female employment rates are already close to those of 
men. Specifically, in countries such as Australia, France, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and the 
United Kingdom, closing the gender employment gap would yield a GDP per capita growth dividend of less 
than 0.1 percentage points annually. In Australia and France, nevertheless, closing the gender 
employment gap would allow recovering more than one fourth of the loss in GDP per capita growth due to 
ageing (cf. Figure 2.9 with Figure 2.7). Further gains can also be obtained by reducing the gender gap in 
hours worked per employed person in countries where these disparities are large (see Box 2.5).

Box 2.5. Growth potential of closing gender gaps in hours worked per worker 
Across the OECD, women typically spend fewer hours in paid work than men (OECD, 2019[77]). While 
Figure 2.9 above presents the potential growth contribution of hypothetical scenarios that assume full 
closure of the gender gap in employment rates by 2060 (i.e. the extensive margin), another potential 
channel stems from reducing the gender gap in hours worked per worker (i.e. the intensive margin). 
Data on hours worked are not available for all OECD countries, and even when available they are not 
always comparable (see notes to Figure 2.10). For the OECD countries where data on hours worked 
are available, Figure 2.10 plots the potential gains of increasing hours worked to the level of the gender 
that works most hours, by 2060. As before, all other assumptions are kept as in the baseline scenario. 
At the OECD level, GDP per capita growth would be 0.16 percentage points higher than in the baseline 
scenario, that is without changes in the gender employment gap, which allows adding up the potential 
effects simulated in this box with those from the other channels in this section.

This average potential effect conceals some degree of heterogeneity, however. Countries with high 
levels of gender equality in hours worked, namely Latvia, Hungary, and Lithuania, would experience 
minimal gains in growth, ranging between 0.03 and 0.04 percentage points. In contrast, for 17 countries, 
growth dividends from closing the gender gap in the intensive margin could be higher than closing it in 
the extensive margin. The contribution of closing the gender gap in hours worked could be particularly 
important in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where women 
more frequently engage in part-time employment than men (OECD, 2019[77]; OECD, 2025[78]). Indeed, 
for these countries, GDP per capita could potentially grow by additional 0.25 percentage points or more 
by 2060, relatively to the baseline scenario. Effective gains could, nevertheless, be smaller, since this 
exercise abstracts from quantifying the costs required to increase hours worked by women – who 
already take up a higher share of unpaid work (see Box 2.6 below) – to the level of men. 
Gender gaps in employment are, however, asymmetrically distributed across the age distribution, which 
implies that, across the OECD area, more than one-third of the potential gains in GDP per capita growth 
would come from closing the gender gap for older workers. And in certain countries this figure can be much 
higher. In some cases, this is due to very high employment rates for older men – e.g. in countries such as 
Iceland and Estonia, where 77% and 65%, respectively, of the potential gains from closing the gap are 
concentrated among older women. However, in other countries, the very rapid decline of female labour 
force participation at older age is responsible for this pattern. This is the case in Chile and Hungary, for 
example, where reducing labour market exit rates of older women represents 64% and 70%, respectively, 
of the potential gains.27 Conversely, in other countries such as France, potential gains from closing the 
gender gap are concentrated among prime-age (and young) women, while the effect among older people 
is small. This is mechanically due to the fact that employment rates among older people are relatively low 
for both men and women, particularly for those aged 60 years or more – see OECD (2023[4]) and below – 
thereby limiting potential gains from closing the gender gap in those age categories without simultaneously 
raising employment of older men. 
Closing the gender gap would, however, require a significant increase in the female employment rate, and 
therefore a substantive policy effort to achieve this goal. On average, within the OECD, employment rates 
of working-age women (aged 20 to 64 years) should increase from 67% in 2023 to 81.7% in 2060, that is 
by 14.7 percentage points (Annex Figure 2.A.5), a massive leap. While the fact that younger cohorts tend 
to work more than older cohorts should account for about one fourth of this increase (as reflected in the 
baseline projections), mobilising further the female labour supply to close the gender employment gap 
would require a genuine, additional jump in employment rates of working-age women by 11.2 percentage 
points. The required increase in the employment rate of working-age women would be particularly large 
(more than 25 percentage points) in Türkiye and all Latin American OECD countries, except Chile. 
Increases of more than 15 percentage points beyond cohort effects will also be necessary in some 
Southern European countries such as Greece and Italy. 
Policy should therefore address the various barriers that are preventing full equality between women and 
men in the labour market not only for equity purposes but also to contribute to offsetting the effect of 
demographic ageing. The 2013 OECD Recommendation of the Council on Gender Equality in Education, 
Employment and Entrepreneurship provides a frame of policy principles to reach this goal (OECD, 
2017[79]): recommended policy interventions to foster gender equality range from promoting equal pay 
practices and gender- and family-friendly policies within firms, facilitating women’s access to science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics studies, and promoting women’s success in entrepreneurship 
and decision-making positions, to significantly upscaling good-quality and affordable childcare and elderly 
care – see also OECD (2017[80]; 2023[81]). Many of these are costly policy interventions, however, 
especially because women take up a disproportionate share unpaid work and family and caring 
responsibilities (see Box 2.6), which can also act as a barrier on women’s labour force participation – see

OECD (2017[80]; 2023[76]).28 Closing the gender employment gap would then require a large increase in 
unpaid family and care work performed by men and/or significant market or government provision of 
affordable childcare and elderly care. 
Box 2.6. Gender gaps in unpaid work 
The take up of unpaid care work and family responsibilities is very different between men and women 
– see e.g. OECD (2017[80]). Time use surveys allow quantifying how much time men and women spend 
in household-related tasks. On average, in the OECD, women spend about four hours per day in unpaid 
care and domestic work, against about two hours in the case of men. What is more, women spend in 
these activities more time than men in all OECD countries, ranging from 1.2 times the number of hours 
spent by men in Belgium and Norway to 5.2 times in Türkiye (see Figure 2.11). 
Figure 2.11. Women spend much more time than men on unpaid care and domestic work

Time use surveys, however, underestimate the gender gap in domestic workload. The reason is that, 
even when they have a job, women spend more time “on call”, that is being ready to face unexpected 
household occurrences during the day that require action from one adult member of the household 
(e.g. a sick child who must be picked up from school). This is reflected in gender differences in 
commuting time and preference for flexible work arrangements – see e.g. Mas and Pallais (2017[82]) 
and Farré, Jofre-Monseny and Torrecillas (2023[83]). Additionally, and perhaps more important, women 
take up an overwhelming share of cognitive domestic work, a taxing but often invisible form of work, 
including for example anticipating needs, identifying options for filling them, making decisions, and

monitoring progress. Evidence suggests that women take up a disproportionate share of cognitive 
household labour in all areas but especially anticipating needs and monitoring (Daminger, 2019[84]; 
Reich-Stiebert, Froehlich and Voltmer, 2023[85]). Effectively increasing labour market participation of 
women, without deteriorating women’s well-being, requires therefore a significant reorganisation of 
family responsibilities, by changing gender norms and redesigning the perimeter of domestic work. 
Raising employment rates of old-age people in good health could lead to large gains in 
GDP per capita growth 
Finally, in many OECD countries, older individuals in good health represent a significant potential source 
of labour resources, which is still insufficiently activated. In particular, while employment of older workers 
has significantly increased for workers below 60 years of age, progress can be made in many countries 
for older age categories (OECD, 2020[8]; 2023[4]). Employment rates across OECD countries indeed vary 
by a factor of four for the 60-64 age group, and almost by a factor of seven for those aged between 65 and 
69 years – see Chapter 3.29 To the extent that the cross-country variation of life expectancy in good health 
at 65 years does not show the same degree of cross-country variation (OECD, 2024[5]),30 this suggests 
significant room for improvement. 
For the purpose of this chapter, an alternative higher-employment-of-older-workers scenario is 
constructed. In this scenario, it is assumed that, by 2060, each country would reduce the employment exit 
rate of older people at least to the level of the best 10% of OECD countries in each age category above 
the 50-54 year-olds.31 The reference values used are those for the gender for which the employment rate 
is the highest.32 To avoid confusing this channel of improvement with the closure of the gender gap (and 
therefore double counting), gender gaps in employment for each age category are assumed to remain as 
in the baseline scenario.33 
By reducing the employment exit rate of older people to that of the best 10% of OECD countries in each 
age category (that is, in the higher-employment-of-older-workers scenario, as described above), about half 
of the OECD countries could gain at least 0.2 percentage point of annual GDP per capita growth 
(Figure 2.12) with respect to the baseline scenario, close to the aggregate gain for the OECD area.34 Not 
surprisingly, compared with the baseline scenario, employment rates could increase in this scenario by 
about 10 percentage points for workers aged 60 years or more, and by a mere 3.5 percentage points for 
those aged from 55 to 59 years (Annex Figure 2.A.8).35 
In a handful of countries, which are already close to the benchmark exit rate for all, or almost all, age 
categories, potential gains from further activating older workers are limited. This is especially the case in 
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand – all countries where, already in 
2023, more than 20% of people aged 65 years or more had a job, and which have relatively high 
employment rates among old-age people in other age categories. For all these countries, potential gains 
in employment rates are limited, and even in the best-case scenario, employment rates among older 
people are likely to fall (see Annex Figure 2.A.8). This reflects changes in the composition of the top age 
category, with a large projected increase of the share of very old people. As a result, potential GDP per 
capita growth gains from mobilising further labour supply of older people are limited to less than 
0.05 percentage points (see Figure 2.12). 
On the other side of the spectrum, in ten continental European countries, including Austria, Belgium, 
France, Czechia, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Spain, the potential gain 
in annual GDP per capita growth from mobilising labour capacity of older workers could be significant. 
Reducing the exit rate of older people so as to match the 10% best-performing countries could bring growth 
dividends as large as 0.4 percentage points, or even more (see Figure 2.12). Specifically, in France, Italy 
and Spain, it could even suffice alone to fully offset the entire projected decline in GDP per capita growth 
due to demographic ageing (as implied by the baseline scenario). However, the required leap in the

employment rates of those aged 55 years or more in these countries would be quite high, especially for 
those aged between 60 and 64 years. In fact, in this scenario and in all these countries, except Czechia, 
the Slovak Republic and Spain, employment rates in this age category would be in 2060 at least 
20 percentage point higher than in 2023, and up to 50 percentage points higher in Luxembourg (see Annex 
Figure 2.A.8). While in many of these countries, the cohort effect account for a small fraction of this 
increase, in all of them more than 70% of it is accounted by the difference in employment rates between 
the higher-employment-of-older-workers and the baseline scenarios.36 By contrast, in Czechia, the 
Slovak Republic and Spain, the greatest potential gain comes from reducing exit rates from employment 
for people aged 65 years of more.

2060, each country would reach in each age category above that of the 50-54 years old (for the gender with the highest employment rate) at 
least the employment rate which would make the rate of decline in employment rates above 55 years of age as small as the 10th percentile of 
the cross-country distribution, as projected in the baseline scenario. For the other gender in each country and age category, projected 
employment rates are assumed to be such that they maintain the same gender employment gap as in the baseline scenario. OECD: Weighted

Sustaining activity and employment of old-age people in good health requires, nevertheless, a complex 
and holistic policy approach (OECD, 2020[8]; 2023[4]; 2024[86]). Policy needs to simultaneously enhance 
incentives to remain in the labour market, sustain employability and labour demand, often by changing 
employers’ attitudes and enhancing job quality and work organisation within firms, while ensuring that older 
workers have the right skills to thrive in the labour market and avoid in-work poverty traps. Equipping older 
workers with skills in demand and addressing barriers to their job mobility will also be important to avoid 
that increasing the share of old-age employment has negative implications for productivity growth. These 
issues will be discussed in detail in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. In addition, health itself is not exogenous to policy,

but can be influenced through prevention policies and better management of chronic diseases so that they 
are less of a barrier to employment, while improving people well-being – see e.g. OECD (2022[87]; 2022[88]; 
2023[89]; 2025[90]). Appropriate workplace policies are also crucial to ensure that longer working life promote 
better health – or at very least do not deteriorate it (see Chapter 3). 
2.3.3. Combining potential gains from different mobilisation strategies 
The various scenarios considered in the previous subsection are complementary, rather than mutually 
exclusive. Countries may indeed pursue simultaneously multiple strategies to mobilise untapped labour 
resources. The scenarios considered here are designed in such a way that they can be, in principle, 
cumulated. Even if, in most countries, none of these alternatives suffices per se, they can be part of an 
overall strategy, which in most cases could compensate the effect of population ageing on the employment-
to-population ratio.37 
According to the stylised simulations presented in the previous section, in all countries but Korea, exploiting 
the full potential of all these channels combined would indeed prevent the employment-to-population ratio 
from declining by 2060, and in certain countries it would even yield a considerable increase, as shown in 
Figure 2.13. The largest contribution would come from mobilising further labour market participation and 
employment of older people. Simultaneously reducing exit rates of older workers to best practices and 
closing the gender gap at older ages (that is cumulating the higher-employment-of-older-workers and the 
gender-equality-for-older-workers scenarios) would increase the share of employed persons in the overall 
population by 4.6 percentage points, twice as much as the effect of closing the gender gap for younger 
age categories. 
However, while the goal of closing the gender gap in employment is relatively consensual within 
society (OECD, 2017[80]; ILO/OECD, 2024[91]), significantly mobilising labour resources from other 
channels often faces societal and political resistance, because of their implications for migration inflows 
(see the previous subsection) and for the length of careers and timing of retirement (Jensen, 2012[92]; 
Häusermann, Kurer and Traber, 2018[93]; Guardiancich and Guidi, 2020[94]; Bello and Galasso, 2020[95]). 
Yet, while closing the gender employment gap among prime-age and young people would avoid the fall in 
the employment-to-population ratio in the OECD area as a whole in the simulations presented in the 
previous section, it would not be sufficient at a country level in all but ten countries (see Figure 2.13). 
Avoiding the decline of the share of employed persons in the population would therefore require, at least 
partially, mobilising other channels. Combining gender equality for prime-age and young people with the 
high migration scenario would barely avoid the drop in employment-to-population ratios in an additional 
five countries. Closing the gender employment gap at all ages would stabilise the share of employed 
persons in the population in 17 countries. By contrast, combining the gender-equality (all ages) and the 
higher-employment-of-older-workers scenarios would stabilise or even further increase the employment-
to-population ratio in all but three countries.

Potential gains in employment rates from combining various scenarios, 2024-60, percentage points 
 
Notes: The chart compares the projected percentage point loss in the share of employment to total population in the baseline scenario with gains 
from alternative scenarios: higher-employment of older-workers, gender equality (elderly), gender equality (prime-age and youth), high migration. 
The higher-employment-of-older-workers scenario is constructed by assuming that, by 2060, each country would reach in each age category above 
that of the 50-54 years old (for the gender with the highest employment rate) at least the employment rate which would make the rate of decline in 
employment rates above 55 years of age as small as the 10th percentile of the cross-country distribution, as projected in the baseline scenario. For 
the other gender in each country and age category, projected employment rates are assumed to be such that they maintain the same gender 
employment gap as in the baseline scenario. The gender equality scenarios assume that by 2060, for both genders, employment rates in each age 
category are as high as that of the gender with the highest rate in the baseline scenario. The high migration scenario sets future net migration rates

Stabilising the share of employed persons in the overall population will not be enough, however, to prevent 
GDP per capita growth from declining. The reason is that, as mentioned in the previous section, the 
contribution of the labour input to growth has always been positive in most countries until now. For example, 
in the whole OECD area, employment growth was still contributing as much as 0.3 percentage points to GDP 
per capita growth in 2006-19.38 As a consequence, even maintaining a moderate increase in the labour input 
would likely be insufficient to prevent a growth slowdown. In fact, while in the whole OECD exploiting the full 
potential of all the labour channels considered in this section could allow cushioning the annual GDP per 
capita growth loss due to demographic change, as projected in the baseline scenario for the period 2024-60, 
this will be insufficient in two-thirds of OECD countries (Figure 2.14, Panel A). Beyond Ireland and the 
United States, where GDP per capita is not projected to decline in the baseline scenario, only in Belgium, 
Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom mobilising all 
these labour resources could fully prevent GDP per capita growth from declining.39 Again, the largest 
contribution would come from mobilising further labour market participation and employment of older people 
in good health. Reducing the employment exit rate of older workers to best practices and closing the gender 
gap at older ages would increase GDP per capita growth by 0.26 percentage points, twice as much as the 
gain that would be obtained from closing the gender gap for young and prime-age workers.40

For a number of countries, however, own growth in 2006-19 may not provide an appropriate benchmark. 
In fact, some of them were still in a catch-up phase of development characterised by high productivity 
dynamism and significant growth in the labour force participation of people of working age, which cannot 
be expected to continue indefinitely at the same pace. Similarly, the three mobilisation scenarios 
considered here are highly stylised simulations that are provided to give an order of magnitude of the 
relative potential of each channel. As a result, they do not necessarily represent jointly attainable targets, 
in particular because of the costly policy interventions that are required to attain each of them. For this 
reason, Figure 2.14, Panel B, compares projected GDP per capita growth in a scenario incorporating the 
mobilisation of two-thirds of untapped labour resources with the annual growth rate of GDP per capita of 
the entire OECD area in 2006-19 (1.0%, see Figure 2.7), arguably two more reachable benchmarks. For 
the OECD area, mobilising these untapped resources to reach just two-thirds of their potential would allow 
cushioning 70% of the annual loss in GDP per capita growth due to demographic change as projected in 
the baseline scenario for the period 2024-60, reaching a projected annual GDP per capita growth of 0.9%. 
The projected growth rate of 13 OECD countries (Colombia, Costa Rica, Czechia, Estonia, Ireland, Israel, 
Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Türkiye and the United States) remains above the 
2006-19 cross-country average even in the baseline scenario, despite significant growth losses for many of 
them with respect to their own growth rate in the same period. In two other countries (Hungary and Slovenia), 
growth could be kept higher than the OECD average of 2006-19 if two-thirds untapped labour resources from 
all channels were activated. Moreover, mobilising two-thirds of untapped labour resources would suffice to 
keep annual GDP per capita growth within 0.5 percentage points per year from the benchmark in all but nine 
countries (Austria, Chile, Finland, Greece, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland). The 
remaining gap can be closed by developing the appropriate reforms to revive productivity growth – see 
e.g. OECD (2018[54]), Draghi (2024[96]), André and Gal (2024[97]) and Chapter 5 – up to a realistically 
reachable level. For all these countries, achieving a rate of growth in GDP per person employed that is no 
more than half of the median for the 1990s for all countries would allow reaching this benchmark growth or 
remaining within about 0.1 percentage points of it (see Annex Figure 2.A.9). 
Overall, these findings suggest that only a comprehensive policy strategy, involving a substantial 
mobilisation of untapped labour resources and making the most of the employment potential of older 
people, could avoid that demographic change brings about a significant decline GDP per capita growth. 
Any other strategy to prevent this decline would not only risk falling short of the target but would also imply 
a significant burden on younger cohorts, as a smaller working-age labour pool will have to produce more 
just to maintain living standards of a larger dependent population. This would have significant fairness 
implications and would jeopardise societal cohesion. The next section will delve into these issues, by 
looking at the extent and dynamics of intergenerational inequalities. 
2.4. Inequalities in living standards across generations 
The results in the previous section show that mobilising untapped labour resources will be key to avoid 
declining GDP per capita growth and, therefore, stagnating average living standards. Yet, even if 
OECD countries meet this challenge, demographic change will have profound consequences for the 
distribution of resources across people of different ages in the population. 
As the youngest baby boomers approach retirement, OECD societies with declining working-age 
populations will have to secure adequate incomes and care for unprecedentedly large generations of 
retirees. In 2021, old-age and survivors’ pensions accounted for 38% of public social expenditure across 
OECD countries – approximately 8.5% of GDP (see Annex Figure 2.A.10, Panel A).41 Spending on older 
people also accounts for about half of all health expenditure, which, at 30% of total public social spending 
(or 6.6% of GDP), constitutes the second-largest expenditure category.42 For comparison, OECD countries 
dedicated only 2.1% of GDP to family benefits, and around 1.1% to out-of-work income support for working-

age adults through unemployment benefits and social assistance (OECD, 2025[98]). As OECD populations 
continue to age and live longer, expenditure on pensions and health is projected to rise across 
OECD countries, by an average of 0.09 percentage points of GDP annually until 2060, or a cumulative 
3 percentage points (see Annex Figure 2.A.10, Panel B).43 Alongside implications for intergenerational 
fairness, this will leave increasingly little fiscal space for benefits targeted at mitigating poverty, insuring 
against income shocks, and supporting labour market reallocation among the working-age population. 
Given the design of social protection systems in most OECD countries, increased calls on publicly financed 
support and services will need to be funded through the taxes and social security contributions of a 
shrinking working-age population.44 This shift of resources, from current and future generations of working-
age adults towards the dependent old-age population, has strong implications for intergenerational 
equity.45 Moreover, it will compound the existing inequalities in income and wealth across generations that 
are documented in this section. 
2.4.1. Older generations have benefited from higher income growth than the young 
In over two-thirds of OECD countries where data are available, older working-age people (55-64) have 
enjoyed faster income growth than younger working-age people (25-34) over the past three decades. The 
gap in equivalised disposable household income between older working-age people and the young has 
widened in most OECD countries since the mid-1990s, reaching over 10% in many Nordic and Western 
European countries in recent years (Figure 2.15, Panel A).46 Equivalised disposable household income 
assigns household income after tax and transfers, adjusted for household size, to each household 
member. While this adjustment allows for a more accurate comparison of living standards across different 
types of households, it also means that rising female labour force participation alone has raised household 
incomes among the young. Despite this, and improved educational attainment among younger generations 
(Barro and Lee, 2010[99]; Cipollone, Patacchini and Vallanti, 2014[100]), the divergence in income growth 
has persisted. Among the few countries where younger people have enjoyed faster income growth, many 
are in the process of catching up with the most advanced economies, having experienced either strong 
labour productivity growth (Czechia, Poland and the Slovak Republic) or surging labour force participation 
(Chile) over the past decades. These results echo earlier research showing that the incomes of older 
working-age people have grown faster than those of young people across high-income countries (Pancrazi 
and Guiatoli, 2024[101]; Resolution Foundation, 2018[102]),47 a process driven by both larger employment 
gains and stronger earnings growth among older people (Bianchi and Paradisi, 2024[103]). 
The incomes of people of retirement age are also catching up with those of young working-age people.48 
Although across OECD countries the disposable household income of people in their late 20s and early 
30s still exceeds that of people aged 65 years or more by 20%, the gap has narrowed by 10 percentage 
points since the mid-1990s (Figure 2.15, Panel B). In some countries – such as Luxembourg, Italy, Spain 
and Norway – older people now enjoy incomes comparable to, or higher than, those of younger people. 
Disparities in income trajectories across different age groups shed light on the rising intergenerational 
inequalities observed in most OECD countries. Each generation faces unique labour market and 
macroeconomic environments that shape people’s income paths. Workers employed during periods of 
robust labour productivity growth typically experience higher earnings growth than those employed during 
periods of productivity slowdown. Starting one’s career during an economic downturn – as the Millennials, 
who were born after 1980 and graduated in the aftermath of the global financial crisis – can leave lasting 
“scars”, undermining long-term labour market outcomes (Schmillen and Umkehrer, 2017[104]; Genda, 
Kondo and Ohta, 2010[105]) and diminishing the propensity to invest in riskier assets (Malmendier and 
Nagel, 2011[106]). Combined, these factors contribute to disparities in lifetime incomes across generations 
(Freedman, 2023[107]; Guvenen et al., 2017[108]).

Figure 2.15. The relative income position of older people has improved significantly since the 
mid-1990s 
 
Reading note: Panel A. In Denmark (left-hand panel), equivalised disposable household incomes for older working-age people (55-64) are 
currently 40% higher than for younger working-age people (25-34). In the mid-1990s, the two groups had similar incomes. Hence, older working-
age people have fared better than the young over the period. In Chile (right-hand panel), equivalised disposable household incomes for older 
working-age people are nearly 20% lower than for younger working-age people while in the 1990s they were 10% higher. Hence, older working-
age people have fared worse than the young over the period. 
Note: Observation periods vary slightly across countries: mid-1990s refers to 1995 or the closest available year; recent year refers the latest 
pre-COVID year, or 2022/23 if available. Equivalised disposable household income assigns post-tax-and-transfer household income, adjusted 
for household size, to each household member. Average: Unweighted average of the countries shown.

Today’s older generations were fortunate to enjoy substantial income growth throughout their working-age 
years. In all countries where data are available, baby boomers – those born in the 1950s and early 1960s – 
experienced steep growth in disposable household incomes from their 20s to their mid-50s (Figure 2.16). 
This steep increase mirrors sustained labour productivity growth observed in most advanced economies 
in the 1980s and 1990s, when the baby boomers started their careers (OECD, 2024[19]). Their incomes

decline closer to retirement age as their skills depreciate (see Chapter 4) and they gradually exit the labour 
market (see Chapter 3). However, even well into retirement, baby boomers maintain income levels 
exceeding those they enjoyed in their 30s, thanks to – on average – decent pensions and the return on 
the savings they were able to accumulate during their working years. 
While today’s younger generations generally enjoy higher real incomes than their predecessors did at the 
same age, they have seen slower income growth over the course of their lives. Across most countries, with 
few exceptions such as Italy and Spain (Figure 2.16, Panel A), each successive generation has benefitted 
from higher incomes than previous ones at the same age. However, income trajectories have flattened for 
generations following the baby boomers (Figure 2.16, Panel B). This trend is particularly pronounced for 
Millennials who, in many countries, have experienced limited or no income growth in their 20s and 30s. If 
this slowdown persists, Millennials in some countries may enter middle age with real incomes similar to, 
or lower than, those of previous generations. In only a third of countries for which data are available do 
Millennials enjoy higher incomes and similar income trajectories compared to previous generations 
(Figure 2.16, Panel C). 
Two factors explain the flatter income trajectories of Millennials across most OECD countries: 
1. Slowing labour productivity growth since the 2000s: Most advanced economies have suffered from 
a slowdown in labour productivity growth since the early 2000s, and particularly after the 2008 
global financial crisis (GFC) (Goldin et al., 2024[32]; Fernald, Inklaar and Ruzic, 2024[27]; OECD, 
2019[109]; 2024[19]). This deceleration has been more pronounced in Western and Southern Europe, 
and less so in Central and Eastern Europe, Korea and the United States, where productivity growth 
continued to be robust in recent years (OECD, 2019[109]). As highlighted above in this chapter, it 
appears unlikely that labour productivity growth will return to the high rates of the past in advanced 
economies. Millennials could therefore continue to face flatter income trajectories throughout their 
lifetimes. 
2. Scarring effects from compounded economic downturns: Millennials were disproportionately 
affected by the GFC. Job losses were concentrated among younger workers, who were more likely 
to hold temporary and precarious contracts (Carcillo et al., 2015[110]). As a result, the share of young 
people neither employed nor in education or training (NEET) increased sharply and took several 
years to return to pre-GFC levels in several OECD countries. Moreover, young people who secured 
their first jobs during the GFC earned lower wages than earlier cohorts (Schwandt and von 
Wachter, 2019[111]; Altonji, Kahn and Speer, 2016[112]). In many European countries the subsequent 
Eurozone crisis extended challenging labour market conditions for the young well into the 
mid-2010s, resulting in a persistent earnings gap between Millennials and previous generations 
(Freedman, 2023[107]; Bentolila et al., 2021[113]).49 These challenges may result in lower pension 
entitlements and diminished savings capacity in old age for Millennials compared to earlier 
generations, while their expected expenses in old age may rise due to longer life expectancies (see 
Figure 2.1).

Note: For each generation-age group, median incomes are computed by averaging across all survey years from the 1990s to the latest available 
year in which a generation is observed at a given age. To improve robustness, only generation-age groups that appear in at least two survey years 
are included; survey years where the generation-age group represents a larger share of the population receive a greater weight. For some countries, 
given limited LIS data for the most recent years, Millennials are observed only up to age 35. Equivalised disposable household income assigns post-

2.4.2. Intergenerational disparities in household wealth are also large, as older 
generations have benefited from booming asset markets 
Wealth, a critical determinant of households’ living standards and long-term economic well-being, tends to 
be concentrated among older generations. While income represents the ongoing flow of financial resources 
– through earnings from work or capital rents – wealth is the cumulative stock of past savings and asset 
appreciation. Wealth not only has an immediate consumption value, for example when it takes the form of 
housing or collateral. It also has an insurance value providing a buffer against unforeseen income shocks 
or consumption needs. When invested, wealth can generate future income through interest payments and 
dividends. Across 19 OECD economies, households headed by individuals aged 55-65 and 65+ hold, on 
average, net wealth six times greater than those headed by 25-34 year-olds, though with large cross-
country differences (Figure 2.17, Panel A).50 
Evidence on long-term wealth distribution trends, though limited by data availability, indicates widening 
intergenerational disparities. Over the past half-century, wealth-to-income ratios have surged across 
OECD countries, driven by historic gains in equity and housing markets (OECD, 2020[114]). The wealth of 
homeowners now accounts for 95% of national wealth on average (Balestra, Caisl and Hermida, 2025[115]), 
with ownership concentrated among older cohorts who purchased homes during periods of affordability 
(Knoll, Schularick and Steger, 2017[116]; Causa, Woloszko and Leite, 2019[117]). In five of the six 
OECD countries with comparable data since the early-2000s (Spain, Italy, Australia, Germany and 
Canada), the wealth gap between older and younger generations has grown; only the United States shows 
a decline (Figure 2.17, Panel B).51 
The recent tendency towards limited later-life dissaving, and delayed bequests, risk calcifying the 
concentration of wealth among older people (Balestra and Tonkin, 2018[118]). Standard lifecycle models 
(Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954[119]) posit an accumulation of wealth during working years, followed by a 
period of dissaving during retirement, a broad pattern that is indeed observed in household wealth 
distribution data (Cowell et al., 2017[120]). However, contrary to the model’s predictions of post-retirement 
dissaving, older people have increasingly tended to retain wealth in their later years. Such wealth retention 
is likely driven by three main motivations: 
1. To insure against longevity risks as longer lifespans and potential health and long-term care costs 
necessitate precautionary savings; 
2. To provide bequests as older people retain wealth for bequests rather than to use it for 
consumption; and 
3. To retain assets as housing market frictions and incentives to capitalise on property appreciation 
delay decumulation (French, Jones and McGee, 2023[121]). 
A growing literature on this “retirement savings puzzle” finds that while self-insurance against long-term 
care, or uninsured medical expenses, dominates for most households, the bequest motive drives the 
saving among the wealthiest (De Nardi et al., 2025[122]). For example, in the United States, while 53% of 
retirees save primarily for precautionary reasons, the wealthiest 20% are motivated by bequests. Since 
wealth is highly concentrated, the bequest motive dominates for the majority of wealth. 
Among younger cohorts, those without access to bequests and inter vivos gifts increasingly face barriers 
to wealth accumulation. The share of people in their 30s who own their main residence has fallen in 17 out 
of 24 OECD countries over the last three decades, with declines exceeding 15 percentage points in 
Ireland, Greece, the United Kingdom, Spain and Australia (Figure 2.18, Panel A). Lower-income young 
people have been particularly affected (Figure 2.18, Panel B). In the United Kingdom, between 2000 and 
2017, the gap in homeownership rates between those who grew up in rented accommodation and those 
who grew up in owner-occupied homes has doubled (Eyles, Elliot Major and Machin, 2022[123]).52

Falling homeownership among young cohorts reflects multiple pressures: rising house prices have made 
ownership increasingly unaffordable for young households while at the same time mortgage access has 
tightened; economic and labour market conditions for young people have become less secure while the 
increasing cost of rent and high student debt repayments in some OECD countries has reduced their 
capacity to save (OECD, 2020[114]). Even inheritances – traditionally a transfer of wealth from the old to the 
young – are expected to arrive later in life, if they arrive (Bourquin, Joyce and Sturrock, 2020[124]), too late 
to aid home purchases and instead further boosting wealth levels during later working age.

2.4.3. The poverty risk has shifted from the old to the young 
While analyses of median income trajectories and wealth accumulation patterns provide critical insights 
into broader trends in economic well-being across generations, substantial disparities in living standards 
persist, warranting special focus on the least advantaged. Previous OECD research (OECD, 2017[7]) has 
documented a notable shift in poverty risk between age groups from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s,

with the burden moving away from older people towards younger and prime-aged individuals – particularly 
those under 25. Recent data indicate that poverty rates for older people (65+) have declined since the 
mid-2000s in most OECD countries, with 18 out of 32 countries now reporting lower poverty rates for this 
group compared to children (under 18) (Figure 2.19).53 Notably, in 14 of these countries even the “oldest 
old” (76+), who traditionally face higher poverty risk, experience lower poverty rates than children. 
However, old-age poverty remains prevalent in some countries, such as the Baltic states and Korea, often 
disproportionately affecting women (OECD, 2023[4]).

The shift in poverty risk from older to younger generations reflects interrelated demographic, labour market, 
and policy developments. First, the rise in female labour force participation and growing employment of 
older workers has enabled older generations to accumulate longer contribution histories and greater 
pension entitlements. Second, pension reforms implemented since the 1990s, while raising normal 
retirement ages to address fiscal sustainability concerns, included sometimes long transition periods as 
well as “grandfathering” clauses that shield older workers from benefit reductions and tighter eligibility 
conditions. As a result, current retirees and older generations of workers have been less affected than 
future generations will be (OECD, 2019[125]; 2021[126]). Third, the shift in poverty risk may reflect the 
preferences of an ageing electorate and align with broader public perceptions that have traditionally viewed 
older people among the groups most deserving of public support (Heuer and Zimmermann, 2020[127]), 
though recent evidence suggests these attitudes may be evolving – see Hoynes, Joyce and Waters 
(2024[128]) for a discussion of social attitudes in the United Kingdom. 
Moreover, conventional income-based poverty metrics may underestimate true disparities in living 
standards between low-income households of different ages. This is because they do not account for 
differences in non-discretionary spending, notably housing – the largest expenditure item, on average, for 
households across all income groups (OECD, 2019[129]).54 With declining homeownership rates among 
younger generations (Figure 2.18), a growing share of young adults rent their homes, often at substantial 
cost. According to the OECD Affordable Housing Database, housing costs in the rental market exceed 
those experienced by owner-occupiers in 34 of 37 OECD countries even when principal repayment is 
included in mortgage costs (OECD, 2024[130]). The concentration of young people in expensive 
metropolitan areas for study or work further exacerbates intergenerational cost disparities. When 
combining all forms of tenure, households where the oldest member is aged between 25-34 spend on 
average 14 percentage points more of their disposable income on rent or mortgage costs than households 
where the oldest member is older than 65 (OECD, 2025[131]). Consequently, the share of young people 
living with parents has been on the rise in some OECD countries (OECD, 2020[114]), delaying independent 
living, geographic mobility, and family formation.55 
Accounting for the financial benefits of homeownership further widens measured disparities in poverty risk 
between older people and the young. Once imputed rent – i.e. the economic value homeowners derive 
from living in their own properties instead of renting at market value56 – is added to homeowners’ 
disposable income, poverty rates among older people decline, to 10.9% across 24 OECD countries with 
available data (see Annex Figure 2.A.12, Panel A).57 By contrast, poverty rates modestly rise for children 
(to 14.8%) and working-age people (to 10.7%), as the relative poverty threshold increases due to this 
adjustment, and because these groups are less likely to live in households who own their homes. When 
accounting for imputed rent, older people are less likely to be in poverty than children in 21 of 
24 OECD countries with available data – only in Estonia, Lithuania and Switzerland do older people remain 
the most vulnerable to poverty. In nine OECD countries (Slovak Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, 
Luxembourg, Greece, France, Spain, Italy and Czechia), the poverty rate among older people is less than 
half that observed among children. And furthermore, examining trends over time, after accounting for 
imputed rent, relative poverty rates for older people have declined since the turn of the century in 8 of the 
14 OECD countries with time series data available (see Annex Figure 2.A.12, Panel B), further widening 
the intergenerational poverty gap. 
The trends described in this chapter – ageing populations, soaring dependency ratios, and a declining 
labour force called on to finance the needs of a growing dependent population – have profound implications 
for the distribution of resources between different age groups. Expanding the labour force, and 
strengthening participation, as outlined in the previous section, will be central to maintaining living 
standards. Yet beyond this, if countries are to meet anticipated fiscal demands and avoid exacerbating the 
implications of demographic change on intergenerational fairness, they may need to re-examine the 
composition of funding sources and the balance of contributions and benefits across the life cycle. A 
rebalancing of labour and capital income taxation could help secure the financing of social protection and

support employment and wage growth (OECD, 2024[132]). Well-designed inheritance taxes and a greater 
role for recurrent taxes on immovable property, could stymie further house price increases and help reduce 
wealth disparities (Causa, Woloszko and Leite, 2019[133]; OECD, 2018[134]; 2021[135]). Meanwhile, 
rebalancing social expenditure toward early-life investments – including childcare and family support – 
could alleviate financial pressures on young families and raise living standards, while helping to close the 
gender employment gap and improving long-term productivity. 
2.5. Concluding remarks 
The secular increase in longevity and decline in fertility have raised OECD countries dependency ratios 
and will continue to do so in the future. OECD countries are therefore moving from a regime in which the 
labour input was contributing to GDP per capita growth to another in which labour input declines will 
represent a drag on growth in the next 35 years. Without further policy action and/or change in individual 
labour market attachment, this will weigh significantly on economic growth and the capacity of 
OECD countries to continue improving their living standards. Moreover, the evidence suggests that 
demographic change has strong implications for intergenerational inequality. 
This chapter has explored, by means of simple simulations of highly stylised, complementary scenarios, 
the potential of different avenues to address the growth challenges brought about by often dramatic 
population ageing. It first notes that the perspectives concerning reviving productivity growth are uncertain, 
and therefore relying exclusively on the hope of a sustained acceleration of productivity growth would be 
a dangerous strategy. By contrast, mobilising untapped labour resources appears to have a significant 
potential. Each of the avenues considered here (closing the gender gap, raising employment of older 
people and increasing migration) could have a significant positive impact on GDP per capita growth. 
Increasing employment of older people appears to be one of the labour resource avenues with the largest 
potential. Reducing their employment exit rate to that of the best 10% of OECD countries and closing the 
gender employment gap at old age could increase OECD GDP per capita growth by 0.26 percentage 
points, about 60% of the projected decline of GDP per capita growth in the baseline scenario. Mobilising 
the employment potential of older people in good health would not only be necessary to effectively offset 
the effect of ageing on growth but also any alternative strategy would be problematic for fairness reasons 
as intergenerational inequalities have progressed in favour of older generations. 
The remainder of this book will delve deeper into the challenges of ageing for the labour market and the 
policy solutions. Chapter 3 focuses on policies needed to increase activity and employment rates of old-
age people and at the same time ensure that they can thrive in the labour market by accessing good-
quality jobs. Beyond making sure that workers have the right incentives to stay in the workforce longer and 
plan for longer careers, it is crucial to guarantee that labour demand does not decline with age and that 
older people remain employable. Employers, governments and social partners all have a role in improving 
lifelong learning, job quality and promoting healthy workplaces to ensure the continuing employability and 
well-being of older workers. But policy attention and actions should also focus on mid-career workers, 
since one of the key findings of Chapter 3 is that continuous employment in one’s 50s is a crucial 
determinant of labour market attachment and employment trajectories in one’s 60s. 
Lifelong learning is essential: Chapter 4 indeed shows that information-processing skills and physical 
abilities decline with age. Moreover, labour market changes tend to make obsolete some skills held by 
older cohorts. Training participation and learning-by-doing, however, also decrease with age. Policies need 
not only to promote lifelong learning and improve training opportunities for older workers but also provide 
career guidance services to help mid-career and older workers reflect on their professional trajectories and 
address any skills gaps, especially as some professions allow more easily older workers to stay in the 
labour market longer.

Addressing skill gaps can also partially reduce the possible negative effect of an ageing structure of 
employment on productivity, which is feared by many (see Box 2.3). Beyond the fact that that productivity 
at some point declines with age, one of the reasons of this concern is that older workers are less mobile, 
so that an ageing workforce could in practice slow down growth-enhancing labour reallocation. Chapter 5 
investigates how external mobility, and the related cross-firm reallocation process, raises productivity 
growth, and the related possibility that a greater share of older workers in employment could imply slowing 
productivity growth. The chapter finds that there is clear evidence of a steep negative gradient between 
age and job-to-job mobility, which has slowed, and may continue to slow, aggregate wage and productivity 
growth. Addressing frictions and bottlenecks affecting this gradient will therefore be important to avoid that 
workforce ageing has a negative impact on productivity growth.

some of the age categories above 50-54 years old are, in the baseline scenario, higher than the average in the countries with exit rates below 
the first decile of the cross-country distribution (or, equivalently, with a ratio of employment rates in the relevant age category to those in the 
category 50-54 years old above the 90% percentile). Straight lines indicate employment rates profiles in the baseline scenario. The dashed line 
indicates the employment rate profile in the higher-employment-of-older-workers scenario.

Annex Figure 2.A.7. Accounting for the intensive margin has limited effect on the growth potential 
of old-age people in most countries 
Percentage point difference in avg. GDP per capita growth: baseline vs. older workers scenarios, 2024-60 
 
Notes: The chart compares projected percentage point differences in average annual GDP per capita growth rates between the baseline scenario 
and two scenarios with high employment of older workers: one i) accounting for the difference in hours worked by older workers relatively to the 
average worker (scenario including intensive margin) and another ii) not considering differences in hours worked (considered in the main text). 
The higher-employment-of-older-workers scenario is constructed by assuming that, by 2060, each country would reach in each age category 
above that of the 50-54 years old (for the gender with the highest employment rate) at least the employment rate which would make the rate of 
decline in employment rates above 55 years of age as small as the 10th percentile of the cross-country distribution, as projected in the baseline 
scenario. For the other gender in each country and age category, projected employment rates are assumed to be such that they maintain the 
same gender employment gap as in the baseline scenario. OECD: Weighted average of the countries shown. p.p.: percentage points. GDP:

Notes: The chart compares projected percentage point differences between employment rates in 2023, the baseline scenario in 2060, and a 
scenario that increases the employment rate of older workers. The alternative higher-employment-of-older-workers scenario is constructed by 
assuming that, by 2060, each country would reach in each age category above that of the 50-54 years old (for the gender with the highest 
employment rate) at least the employment rate which would make the rate of decline in employment rates above 55 years of age as small as

Annex Figure 2.A.9. Mobilising untapped human resources and improving productivity growth 
would restore GDP per capita growth 
Annual GDP per capita growth and potential gains from different strategies, 2024-60 
 
Notes: The chart compares, on the one hand, the average real GDP per capita growth attainable from an alternative comprehensive strategy 
both mobilising all alternative labour channels at two-thirds of their potential and reviving productivity growth and, on the other hand, the cross-
country mean growth rate in 2006-19. Productivity is supposed to be revived up to the level that the country growth of GDP per person employed 
would reach half of the 1991-2000 cross-country median (the potential gains by attaining this goal are indicated as “Potential gains from prod. 
increase”). The higher-employment-of-older-workers scenario is constructed by assuming that, by 2060, each country would reach in each age 
category above that of the 50-54 years old (for the gender with the highest employment rate) at least the employment rate which would make 
the rate of decline in employment rates above 55 years of age as small as the 10th percentile of the cross-country distribution, as projected in 
the baseline scenario. For the other gender in each country and age category, projected employment rates are assumed to be such that they 
maintain the same gender employment gap as in the baseline scenario. The gender equality scenarios assume that by 2060, for both genders, 
employment rates in each age category are as high as that of the gender with the highest rate in the baseline scenario. The high migration 
scenario sets future net migration rates equal to the 75th percentile of the cross-country distribution in 2021-24. Y. & P.A.: young and prime-age.

Annex Figure 2.A.10. Pensions and health account for the bulk of public social expenditure 
 
Note: Panel A allocates public social expenditure on old-age and survivors’ pensions to older individuals. To obtain age-specific health 
expenditure shares relative to GDP it applies the relative spending shares presented by Morgan and Mueller (2023[136]) to the public health 
expenditure data provided in the OECD Social Expenditure Database (2025[98]). For countries where data on age-specific public health 
expenditure are not available but which provide information on public and private health expenditure concurrently, it assumes that the age 
distributions of public and private health expenditure are identical. Health expenditure figures include most of countries’ public expenditure on 
long-term care. For countries in which health expenditure data by age group exclude long-term care, the share of long-term care expenditure 
allocated to those aged above 65 years is assumed to match this group’s share of long-term care beneficiaries. If that information is also missing 
the OECD unweighted average is used instead. Panel B displays historical (2010-29) and projected (2024-60) annual percentage point growth 
of health and pension expenditure as a share of GDP. Countries ordered by the difference between historical and projected annual changes. 
OECD represents the unweighted average of OECD countries in Panel A, while in Panel B it represents part of the OECD area corresponding 
to the 33 countries with available data. 
Source: Panel A uses OECD calculations based on the Social Expenditure Database, OECD Historical population data; OECD Health Statistics; 
US Census Bureau Population Vintage 2019 national population estimates; Morgan and Mueller (2023[136]), “Understanding international 
measures of health spending: Age-adjusting expenditure on health”, https://doi.org/10.1787/043ed664-en; Sengupta et al. (2022[137]), “Post-

Percentage of the average wage, 2023 
 
Note: Data refer to 2023 policies. Results for a two-earner couple with two children aged 2 and 3 respectively. The first earner earns 100% of 
the average wage and the partner earns 67% of the average wage. The category “Childcare Benefits” includes entitlements related to the use 
of childcare facilities as well as benefits that aim to provide support to those looking after children at home. This category includes also any fee 
discounts for childcare users applied in particular family circumstances. The group “Changes in taxes” refers to the change in taxes related to 
having children, i.e. comparing the taxes paid by a couple without children to those of an identical couple with children. “Changes in other 
benefits” includes changes in housing and family allowances related to the use of childcare. Information on net childcare costs is currently 
missing for Türkiye. Average: Unweighted average of the countries shown.

Annex Figure 2.A.12. Accounting for housing costs amplifies the difference in poverty rates 
between older people and children, both in levels and in trends 
 
Note: Poverty rates give the share of people living in households with an equivalised disposable household income of less than 50% of the 
national median. Equivalised disposable household income assigns post-tax-and-transfer household income, adjusted for household size, to 
each household member. Observation periods in Panel B vary slightly across countries: early-2000s refers to 2000 or the closest available year; 
recent year refers the latest pre-COVID year, or 2022/23 if already available. Gross imputed rents are an estimate of the value that homeowners 
would pay in the rental market for their home. Most countries estimate imputed rents using a regression or stratification method based on actual 
rents (i.e. a prediction of the price associated to a house based on the rents paid for similar dwellings), except for CHL, COL, ITA and MEX that 
use the self-assessment method (i.e. the self-reported price that households believe they would pay to rent their own houses), and CZE, EST 
and SVK that employ the user-cost method (i.e. the rate of return to investing home equity in an interest-bearing account). See Balcázar et al., 
(2017[139]) for a review of rent imputation methods. Net imputed rents subtract property tax and mortgage interest payments from gross values. 
For countries for which net imputed rents cannot be calculated, gross values are used instead. The country rankings shown in this figure should 
be interpreted with caution, because of differences in imputation methods and limited data availability. Average: Unweighted average of the 
countries shown and for which net imputed rents were available.

Notes
 
1 According to the medium scenario of UN population projection, the overall population will be larger in 
2060 than in 2023 in half of the OECD countries and in the OECD as a whole (United Nations, 2024[11]). 
2 There is, however, a large uncertainty about future fertility trends (United Nations, 2025[159]). Yet, the 
whole 95% probability interval around medium projections remains well below the level required for 
population replacement. 
3 Usually, a total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered necessary for population replacement without positive 
net migration rates – see United Nations (2007[150]) 
4 In fact, it will increase steeply until 2050, to stabilise afterwards in most countries. 
5 The overall dependency ratio (not shown in the chart) is typically defined as the ratio of the sum of the 
population aged less than 15 years and 65 years and more to the population aged 15-64 years – see 
United Nations (2007[150]). 
6 The medium scenario corresponds to the median of UN probabilistic projections. Other population 
projections, such as those of Eurostat or national statistical agencies, provide quantitatively different results 
although pointing in the same direction (OECD, 2023[4]). Here UN projections are preferred for 
comparability reasons.

𝜋 is hourly labour productivity, h are average hours worked, ER is the employment rate and DR is the

8 Especially due to the increase over time of female labour market participation. 
9 Fluchtmann, Keese and Adema (2024[16]) take cohort-specific observed labour force participation and 
unemployment rates as starting points and derive future rates by assuming constant future unemployment 
rates and that, for each age and gender category, future labour market entry and exit rates are equal to 
the most recent rates of the same age category (averaged over a 5-year period and excluding the years 
of the COVID-19 crisis). The labour market entry rate is defined as the percentage change in non-
employment rates from age t to age t+1 for the same cohort, when negative and zero otherwise (that is the 
percentage decrease when it is effectively a decrease). The labour market exit rate is defined as the 
percentage change in employment rates from age t to age t+1 for the same cohort, when this is negative 
and zero otherwise (that is, again, the percentage decrease when it is effectively a decrease). By 
construction, therefore, the effect of future health and education improvements and possible structural 
reforms that might affect entry and exit rates are not taken into account. To obtain final employment rate 
projections, projected age- and gender-specific employment rates are then combined with UN projections 
on population size and structure (medium scenario). Then, in Figure 2.6, the direct effect of changes in the 
population structure is obtained by assuming constant age- and gender-specific employment rates as in 
2023; the cohort-replacement effect is measured as the difference between the baseline projection (which 
incorporates age- and gender-specific employment rate projections) and the constant-employment rate 
projection.

10 In Colombia, Spain and Israel, the cohort-replacement channel has a significant negative contribution 
due to a significant drop in the labour force of the younger cohorts in the second half of the 2010s. 
11 0.7% per year in the case of the whole OECD area. This assumption could be considered prima facie 
realistic in the long run. Recent OECD work in this area, including the OECD long-term projection model, 
indeed assumes constant returns to scale and constant capital-labour ratios in the long run – see 
e.g. Guillemette and Turner (2018[140]; 2021[141])) and Fluchtmann, Keese and Adema (2024[16]). 
12 More recent years are excluded from the calculation of benchmark productivity trends to avoid the 
influence of the COVID-19 crisis. The period 2006-19 is chosen to cover a full business cycle and to have 
start and end points corresponding to similar stages of the business cycle. Robustness exercises (available 
upon request) using different periods (2007-19, 2006-18 and 2007-18) show similar results – that is a 
projected drop of OECD GDP per capita of about 40%, and a projected growth reduction in all 
OECD countries except Ireland and the United States. 
13 IMF (2025[12]) projects a larger slowdown (0.5 percentage points for the whole world for the period 
2025-50, and more for advanced economies). However, this is by and large due to the fact that 2016-18, 
which is a period of fast labour input growth during the expansionary phase of the previous business cycle, 
is taken as comparison. Using the same period as benchmark, the projection method used here would 
deliver qualitatively similar results. 
14 From a dynamic point of view the decline in GDP per capita growth is projected to start around 2030 
and peak in 2045-50 in most countries and the OECD area. Results are available from the OECD 
Secretariat upon request. 
15 Analysing whether reducing working hours per worker implies an increase of living standards is beyond 
the scope of this chapter. For an extensive discussion of working hours and living standards see 
OECD (2021[17]; 2022[18]). 
16 The reason for the productivity slowdown is not consensual in the literature. Deceleration in human 
capital accumulation, physical capital investment and trade expansion, and technological bottlenecks 
leading to imbalances across sectors are among the cited explanations – see e.g. Goldin et al. (2024[32]) 
and Acemoglu, Autor and Patterson (2024[155]). 
17 Other researchers are, however, less optimistic about the potential of AI in terms of aggregate 
productivity growth – see e.g. Acemoglu et al. (forthcoming[145]).

19 In certain countries, some untapped labour resources can also be found among jobless prime-age men. 
From a macroeconomic perspective, however, the potential contribution of this channel is minor. In fact, 
the cross-country variance of employment rates of prime-age men is small, suggesting limited potential 
gains from boosting employment of this group – see e.g. OECD (2017[142]; 2018[54]).

20 Defined as the difference between the change in the stock of foreign-born in the host country between 
year t-1 and t and the change in the stock of native-born living abroad between t-1 and t, both expressed 
in percentage the overall size of the population in the host country in t-1. 
21 Projected net migration rates are lower in two-thirds of the OECD countries with positive net migration 
rates in 2021-24 (Annex Figure 2.A.4) and two-thirds of those with positive rates in 2016-20 (United 
Nations, 2024[63]). They are also lower in 55% of the OECD countries with positive net migration rates in 
2010-15. 
22 Or their competences are not recognised (OECD, 2017[66]). 
23 Especially because long-term trends in employment gaps between natives and foreign-born represents 
one key area of monitoring and integration policy action, which is left out of this analysis. 
24 In these simulation exercises, the increase in net migration flows is redistributed proportionally to the 
projected net migration flows by gender and age category entailed by the baseline scenario after shifting 
the minimum of the distribution to zero. 
25 The overall projected gains for the whole OECD area are smaller (0.10%), due to limited or no gains in 
some large countries such as Mexico. 
26 Constant growth of GDP per person employed is among the maintained assumptions. This implies that 
the simplified gender equality scenario considered here entails a lower incidence of part-time work among 
women entering employment, as the female part-time rate is currently higher than in the overall population 
in all OECD countries – see e.g. the Statistical Annex of this publication. 
27 In particular, in these two countries in 2023, the ratio of female employment rates between those aged 60 
to 64 years and those aged 50 to 54 years were more than three times larger than the same ratio for their 
male peers (see OECD Data Explorer, “Employment and unemployment by five-year age group and sex 
– levels”, http://data-explorer.oecd.org/s/253). 
28 Overcoming gender disparities in childcare and elderly care is also important to reduce the exit rate of 
women from the labour market (Van Houtven, Coe and Skira, 2013[144]; Maestas, Messel and 
Truskinovsky, 2024[143]) and therefore close the gender gap in employment rates at old age – see also 
Chapter 3. Yet, retirement policies also play a crucial role for the gender employment gap in these age 
categories, since married couples tend to take joint retirement decisions, with spouses typically anticipating 
or delaying their exit from employment to match their husbands’ retirement (Gustman and Steinmeier, 
2000[146]; Lalive and Parrotta, 2017[147]; Johnsen, Vaage and Willén, 2021[148]; Carta and De Philippis, 
2023[151]; García-Miralles and Leganza, 2024[149]). 
29 By contrast, they vary only by a factor of two in the age category 55-59 years, and by much less than 
that if Türkiye is excluded. 
30 In particular, the cross-country coefficient of variation of life expectancy in good health at 65 years is 
almost half of that of employment rates in the 65-69 age category. 
31 That is, by 2060, each country would reach in each age category above the 50-54 year-olds at least that 
employment rate that would reduce the decline in employment rates above 55 years to that at the 10th 
percentile of the cross-country distribution, as projected in the baseline scenario. More precisely, in the

higher-employment-of-older-workers scenario, for each country and age category, the employment rate of 
the gender with the highest employment rate by 2060 in the baseline scenario is obtained in multiple steps: 
i) for each country and gender, the ratios between the employment rate of each age category 
above 54 years (55-59 years, 60-64 years and 65 years and above) and the employment rate of those 
aged between 50 and 54 years in the same country is computed; ii) for each country and relevant age 
category, the gender with the highest ratio is selected and its ratio is taken; iii) the 90th percentile of the 
cross-country distribution of the retained ratios is then computed for each age category above 54 years – 
these ratios will be called “target ratios” hereafter; and finally, iv) for each country and age category, the 
employment rate of the gender with the highest employment rate is multiplied by the corresponding “target 
ratio”, thereby reducing the exit rate from employment of this group, except if the employment rate of this 
group is higher in the baseline scenario (in which case it is left unchanged). This is a neater benchmark 
than using the top percentiles of the cross-country distribution of employment rates that confounds gender 
employment changes, and even prime-age employment shifts, with employment changes due exclusively 
to the exit rate from employment of older workers. Note that countries with the best retained ratios are not 
necessarily those with the highest employment rates (although often this is the case). In certain countries, 
the employment rate of a given age category maybe above that of the average of the countries with 
retained ratios above the 90th percentile, and yet the employment rate would increase because the 
projected exit rate would decrease in this scenario (see Annex Figure 2.A.6). Note also that net exit rates 
from employment are positive also for workers aged 45-54 years – see Chapter 3. However, they are 
typically very small until age 55-59 years. For this reason, and to simplify the text, age category 
50-54 years is taken as the reference category, and the term older workers refer to workers aged 55 years 
and more, as standard. Nevertheless, repeating the exercise using age category 40-44 as reference 
category would yield similar results. 
32 In the baseline scenario, there are some countries and age category in which women are projected to 
have in 2060 a marginally higher employment rate than men. 
33 As the projection method concerns only the gender with the highest employment rate, the employment 
rate of the other gender is simply obtained by applying the gender gap as projected in the baseline 
scenario. 
34 As data on hours worked by age and gender are not available (or not comparable) in all OECD countries 
(see Box 2.5), this scenario assumes that any increase in employment of older workers would not alter the 
growth of GDP per employed person. This is unrealistic because older workers work fewer weekly hours. 
However, as shown in Annex Figure 2.A.7, for the countries for which data are available, recalculating the 
contribution of higher employment of older workers by assuming that each new older worker would work 
the same number of hours as the average of currently employed peers in the same age and gender 
category results in only a small reduction of the simulated potential gains from this channel – about 10% 
for the whole OECD area. 
35 An additional small boost can already be expected by the fact that younger cohorts tend to work more 
than older cohorts, especially in the case of women (cohort effect). This simple cohort effect would already 
result in greater employment rates in 2060 than in 2023 in the baseline scenario, particularly for those 
aged between 55 and 64 years (Annex Figure 2.A.8). For those above 65 years, the overall cohort effect 
will be compounded by the change in the age composition of this category, and employment rates are 
projected to fall in the baseline scenario in many countries, especially those with already relatively high 
employment rates.

36 A large increase in employment rates in this age category is also implied for Türkiye in this scenario. 
However, the simple cohort effect, as included in the baseline scenario, would account for more than half 
of it. 
37 It must be kept in mind, however, that these scenarios are highly stylised and presented here as a metric 
to grasp the magnitude of the potential of each channel. They should not be viewed as a precise forecast. 
38 Cf. the growth rates of GDP per capita and GDP per person employed in Figure 2.7 above. 
39 In the case of Greece and Italy, however, projected GDP per capita growth rates would remain negative. 
40 Note that, as mentioned above, given the assumptions on productivity growth, there is a one-to-one 
correspondence of the relative effects of different channels on the employment-to-population ratio and 
GDP per capita growth. 
41 The OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX) currently provides data on public social expenditures 
up to 2023, but breakdowns by spending category still only reach up to 2021 for most countries (OECD, 
2025[98]). 
42 Across the 18 OECD countries for which public health expenditures can be allocated by age, 11 devote 
more than half to people aged above 65 years, while only in Australia less than 45% of public health 
expenditure go to older people (Morgan and Mueller, 2023[136]).Health expenditure figures include most of 
countries’ public expenditure on long-term care, which accounts for about 1.8% of GDP across 
OECD countries on average but reaches more than 3% of GDP in countries such as the Netherlands, 
Norway, Sweden and Belgium (OECD, 2023[152]). 
43 See also Koutsogeorgopoulou and Morgavi (forthcoming[161]). 
44 In the two decades leading up to the COVID-19 crisis, revenues from social contributions as a share of 
GDP have increased in the OECD area, from 8.4% in 2000 to 8.9% in 2019, while financing a declining 
share of social spending, from 47.5% down to 43.5% (Immervoll, 2024[156]). 
45 At the same time, as population ageing undermines the sustainability of pay-as-you-go social protection 
financing, younger generations face declining benefit generosity. Future retirees in many OECD countries 
are projected to receive lower pension replacement rates than current retirees due to reforms already 
legislated (OECD, 2019[125]). Publicly funded long-term care systems are under-resourced in many 
countries (OECD, 2023[157]). Younger generations therefore confront a dual burden: financing the benefits 
for today’s large pensioner cohort while simultaneously accumulating private savings to compensate for 
less generous public benefits in their own retirement. 
46 For data on income levels and inequality across OECD countries over long time horizons, see also the 
OECD Income Distribution Database, www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/income-and-wealth-distribution-
database.html. 
47 Pancrazi and Guiatoli (2024[101]) cover a large set of OECD and non-OECD countries for the period from 
2004 to 2018. Their methodological approach slightly differs from the one employed in this section in that 
Pancrazi and Guiatoli focus on individual rather than equivalised disposable household income, and use 
slightly different age brackets and average incomes across several years.

48 In some countries, such as Australia and Switzerland, retirees are allowed to take all or part of their 
mandatory pension entitlements as a lump sum when they retire. Because LIS data do not follow people 
over time, such lump sums cannot be smoothed across retirement years in the analysis. In any given 
survey year, retirees who have already withdrawn will therefore appear to have lower incomes. As the 
results in Figure 2.16 average across all people aged 65 or older, mixing retirees withdrawing that year 
with those who withdrew earlier, the net impact on the mean income of retirees is likely to be modest. By 
contrast, the impact on poverty statistics is potentially large (see Section 2.4.3 below). 
49 Young people were also disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and their employment rates 
recovered more slowly than those of prime-aged and older workers (OECD, 2022[18]). 
50 The wealth measure used here follows earlier OECD analysis in excluding any wealth held in 
occupational pension schemes, though wealth in voluntary private pension schemes is included (Balestra 
and Tonkin, 2018[118]). Wealth differences across age groups would be larger still if occupational pensions 
were considered. 
51 The wealth gap between older and younger generations has grown also in the United States when 
considering only the period up to 2019. 
52 There is some evidence that within-generation wealth inequalities have risen in some countries. In the 
United States, the poorest Millennials have less wealth than their baby boomer counterparts, but the 
wealthiest Millennials have more (Gruijters, Van Winkle and Fasang, 2023[160]). 
53 In some countries, such as Australia and Switzerland, retirees are allowed to take all or part of their 
mandatory pension entitlements as a lump sum when they retire. Because LIS data do not follow people 
over time, such lump sums cannot be smoothed across retirement years in the analysis. In any given 
survey year, retirees who have already withdrawn will therefore appear to have lower incomes. This is 
likely to overestimate the poverty rates of older people in Figure 2.19 and Annex Figure 2.A.12 for these 
countries. 
54 As labour market participation among women has risen, childcare costs increasingly eat into 
discretionary spending. On average across the OECD, the net childcare costs facing a two-earner couple 
with two children under four account for 11% of the average wage, reaching as high as 40% in the 
United States (Annex Figure 2.A.11, see OECD calculator of taxes and benefits, https://www.oecd.org/
en/data/tools/oecd-calculator-of-taxes-and-benefits.html). For a broader discussion of the implications of 
essential expenditures for inequalities in living standards, see Balestra and Oehler (2023[154]). 
55 In 17 OECD countries, more than 50% of young people in their 20s live with their parents, with the 
shares exceeding 75% in Korea, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the Slovak Republic (OECD, 
2024[158]). 
56 Some tenants may not rent their properties at market value because they live in subsidised or rent-free 
housing. However, for seven out of the 24 OECD countries covered in the analysis, LIS data on imputed 
rents only provide information on homeowners. For better comparability, information on imputed rent for 
tenants paying below market value was therefore not considered even where available. 
57 The country rankings shown in Annex Figure 2.A.12 should be interpreted with caution given imperfect 
harmonisation of imputation methods and limited data availability. For a discussion of the implications of 
accounting for imputed rent for poverty analysis, see Mullan, Sutherland and Zantomio (2011[153]).

Over the past two decades, population ageing, increasing statutory 
retirement ages and rising education levels have led to higher employment 
rates among workers aged 55 and above in OECD countries. However, 
progress across countries remains uneven, and employment rates decline 
rapidly from age 60, such that many workers are leaving employment well 
before reaching the eligibility age for a pension. To sustain living standards 
and address structural labour shortages, many countries will need people to 
work beyond 60 or 65. This requires labour market policies and employer 
practices that support the hiring, retention and most importantly the 
employability of mid-to-late career workers. Employers, employees, 
governments and social partners all have a role in promoting lifelong 
learning, improving job quality and promoting healthy workplaces to ensure 
the employability, well-being and economic contribution of older workers in 
an evolving world of work.

the labour market work for older 
workers

In Brief 
Key findings 
As life expectancy continues to rise, and more people remain in good health in their later years, the 
potential to extend working lives also grows. In recent decades, structural factors such as increased 
longevity, the rising labour force participation of women, and rising education levels have contributed 
to higher employment rates across OECD countries. At the same time, rising eligibility ages for 
pensions and tightening early retirement conditions have also promoted higher employment rates of 
older workers. But employment policies have not always kept pace with the changing labour market 
to support longer working lives. 
As stressed in Chapter 2 of the Outlook, population ageing presents a major challenge for 
OECD countries, making it imperative to promote the employment and employability of older workers 
and adapt to fast-changing labour markets. Advances in digital technology and AI are reshaping skill 
demands, with uneven effects: workers in cognitive, non-routine jobs may more easily adapt to AI 
integration, while those in manual roles face higher risks of automation. At the same time, the green 
transition is transforming industries and creating new jobs that require specialised skills. 
The key findings of the chapter are as follows: 
• 
The good news is that the transition to longer working lives is well underway – employment 
rates for older workers have risen significantly across OECD countries over the past two 
decades (2000-24), especially for women. Among women, employment rates have risen by 
10.4 percentage points for those aged 50-54 and 18.5 percentage points for those 
aged 55-59. While employment rates for men have also risen, the gains have been smaller, 
reflecting their historically higher employment levels. 
• 
Despite this progress there remains substantial potential to improve employment outcomes 
for older workers across OECD countries. Employment rates vary significantly, especially for 
those aged 60 and above. In 2024, the average employment rate for people aged 60-64 
across OECD countries was 55.9%, with a wide range – from 77.2% in Iceland to just 25.4% 
in Luxembourg. 
• 
Marked disparities also exist by gender, education level and health status, highlighting 
opportunities to extend working lives. Less-educated older workers have particularly low 
employment rates: among those aged 55-64, the OECD average is 49.2% for individuals with 
below secondary education, compared to 75.3% for those with tertiary qualifications. 
Similarly, employment rates among people with long-term illnesses vary sharply – from just 
22% in Luxembourg to 75% in Sweden (ages 55-64). 
• 
Employment rates still begin to decline from age 50 across OECD countries, and more 
sharply from age 60. A lifecycle perspective is essential, as steady employment during one’s 
50s is correlated with increased likelihood of working into one’s 60s. On average across 
25 European OECD countries and the United States, 69% of those steadily employed in their 
50s remain employed at some point in their 60s. However, only 59% of adults maintain 
continuous employment in their 50s, and of these same workers only 31% are consistently 
employed in their 60s, while 30% do not work at all and 11% have intermittent employment. 
This highlights the need for early interventions to help workers stay employed and improve 
long-term workforce participation.

• 
Reducing incentives to retire early through increasing the statutory retirement age and 
tightening access to early retirement schemes have been at the heart of the policy agenda in 
many OECD countries, and continued efforts are needed to raise the average age of labour 
market exit. Carefully designed flexible retirement options can facilitate transitions to 
retirement and longer working lives. Additionally, ensuring financial literacy and transparency 
in retirement planning is essential to help individuals make informed decisions about their 
retirement decisions. 
• 
Enhancing incentives for older workers to remain in the workforce is important, but not 
enough on its own – they also need greater access to meaningful employment opportunities. 
Therefore, a crucial element of more inclusive ageing and employment strategies is 
motivating employers to both hire and retain them. Achieving this relies on how effectively 
companies manage age diversity and harness the strengths of all age groups. Evidence 
shows that there are positive productivity effects for firms from having a more balanced age 
structure. Yet employers may hesitate to hire or retain older workers due to concerns about 
adaptability, workplace accommodations, and productivity. Age discrimination remains a 
significant barrier. Overcoming these challenges calls for policies that promote both hiring 
and job mobility for older workers. 
• 
Promoting employability throughout working life is essential to improving job opportunities for 
older workers. While some older workers navigate the labour market successfully, others face 
skill gaps and workplace barriers that undermine their competitiveness. Across 
OECD countries, there is often a large gap in access to formal and informal training by age. 
Effective workforce management, access to life-long learning, employee-oriented flexible 
work options, and healthy working conditions are key to fostering supportive workplaces. 
Proactive measures – such as occupational health programmes, job redesign, and phased 
return-to-work initiatives – can help prevent early labour market exit. Policies that support 
women’s employment, including shared parental leave and childcare subsidies, also reduce 
the motherhood penalty and advance gender equity. 
Introduction 
With life expectancy rising and people living longer than ever, many people will want or need to work longer 
as retirement ages increase. In recent decades, demographic shifts and higher pension ages have 
contributed to rising employment rates among late career or older workers across OECD countries. 
However, government employment policies and employer policies have not necessarily kept pace to 
support longer working lives. Despite the improvement in employment rates seen across most 
OECD countries in recent decades, it remains the case that employment rates start declining between the 
age of 50 and 60, and more rapidly after the age of 60. 
This presents a significant challenge for OECD countries. As populations continue to age, ensuring that 
older workers have the opportunities and support they need to stay employed and thrive in ever evolving 
labour markets will be critical policy priority – see also Chapter 2. AI is shifting the demand for skills in the 
labour market by increasing the need for management, business, and digital skills while reducing demand 
for some cognitive and clerical tasks (Green, 2024[1]). The impact of AI on older workers varies significantly 
based on their occupation and level of education; highly educated older workers in professions requiring 
cognitive, non-routine skills are more exposed to AI compared to occupations based on manual skills.1 
However, more routine occupations have a higher risk of automation from all technologies (Lane, 2024[2]). 
Simultaneously, the green transition is transforming industries, creating new roles that require specialised

knowledge, and older workers are more likely to be employed in occupations concentrated in high emission 
sectors (OECD, 2024[3]). 
This chapter highlights key trends in employment, unemployment, inactivity and the type of jobs older 
workers hold – thanks to increases in life expectancy, improvements in education and policy reforms across 
the OECD, older workers are more active in the labour market than ever before. The chapter builds on the 
framework outlined in the OECD Recommendation on Ageing and Employment Policies (OECD, 2022[4]) 
and Working Better with Age (OECD, 2019[5]) and argues that greater efforts are needed to promote the 
labour market inclusion of older workers, especially in countries where employment rates lag behind 
among particular groups of older workers. This requires reducing incentives to retire early and rewarding 
employment at an older age. But it is not sufficient just to improve the incentives for older people to continue 
working longer; expanding opportunities through raising the demand for older workers is also critical. This 
requires removing barriers to employment for older workers, encouraging employers to hire and retain 
them, countering age discrimination, and fostering age-inclusive workplaces. Promoting the employability 
of workers throughout their working lives is also a key requirement for longer, rewarding careers. This 
requires opportunities for lifelong learning, opportunities for career development and mobility, and healthy 
workers in good quality jobs. While this chapter focuses on workers aged 55 and above, it is crucial to 
recognise that many interventions – particularly in health, promoting female participation in the labour 
market, and training – need to occur early and throughout the life cycle. 
The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 3.1 starts by providing an overview of 
employment trends among late career workers. Section 3.2 discusses how pension reforms can improve 
incentives for people to stay in employment for longer and how a variety of flexible retirement options can 
contribute to longer working lives. Section 3.3 argues that it is insufficient just to improve incentives for 
older workers to continue working, they must also have better opportunities to do so. Boosting employer 
demand for older workers through overcoming barriers such as age discrimination, perceptions of higher 
costs, and concerns over adaptability is crucial. Section 3.4 underlines that some barriers affect older 
workers directly, which make it difficult for them to either stay in their existing job or find a new one. 
Enhancing employability throughout working life is key to improving job opportunities for mid-to-late career 
workers. This requires lifelong learning, flexible work arrangements, and proactive measures like 
occupational health programmes and job redesign to prevent early labour market exit. 
3.1. Evolving employment trends among mid-to-late career workers 
3.1.1. Employment rates have increased but significant disparities across 
OECD countries remain 
Employment rates at older ages have risen significantly across OECD countries in recent decades, 
reflecting the fact that people are not only living longer but also staying healthier for longer. This is a positive 
development, as increased longevity is now more often accompanied by the ability to remain active and 
engaged in the workforce. This shift suggests that ageing populations can be a source of strength rather 
than strain, as societies adapt to longer, healthier lives. On average across OECD countries between 2000 
and 2024 the employment rate rose by 9.3 percentage points for those aged 45-64. Several key trends 
emerge: 
• 
The increase in employment rates has been particularly pronounced for women, reflecting both 
demographic shifts, social choices and policy reforms aimed at fostering the workforce participation 
of women. Between 2000 and 2024, the employment rate rose by an average of 10.4 percentage 
points for women aged 50-54 and 18.5 percentage points for those aged 55-59 (Figure 3.1, 
Panel A). Men have also experienced increases in employment rates, albeit to a lesser extent, 

--- Page Break ---
136 

partly reflecting that rates for men were already above those for women. For men aged 55-59 the 
employment rate rose by 9.5 percentage points between 2000 and 2024. 
• 
Employment rates start to decline between the age of 50 and 55, and more rapidly after age 60 
(Figure 3.1, Panel A), a trend that is clear across all OECD countries, despite the increase in 
employment rates at older ages in recent decades. When comparing employment rates at different 
ages across the life course between birth cohorts there is also a clear decline from the mid-50s 
onwards (although there is evidence of a slow decline for men from their late 30s) (Annex 
Figure 3.A.1). 
• 
Employment rates for older workers show some weak signs of convergence across countries. 
Some countries starting with lower rates, like Hungary and the Slovak Republic, saw the biggest 
increases among those aged 55-59 (Figure 3.1, Panel B). At age 60 and above, some countries 
have relatively low employment rates and have also seen a decline since 2000. In Türkiye the 
employment rate for those aged 60-64 has declined by 0.6 percentage points, and in Mexico it has 
risen by only 1.7 percentage points (data for all countries can be seen in Annex Figure 3.A.2).2 
• 
Despite progress, there are still large differences in the level of employment across 
OECD countries, particularly after age 60 (Figure 3.1, Panel C).3 On average, 48% of women and 
64.4% of men aged 60-64 are employed, but rates range widely – from below 21% in Türkiye and 
Luxembourg to over 84% in Iceland and Japan. At ages 65-69 the average employment rate drops 
to 23.7% for women and 36% for men. Only 6% of women in Slovenia and Belgium work at this 
age, compared to over 43% in Japan and Korea. These differences show there is room to boost 
older workers’ employment across the OECD. 
Over the past decades, several key factors have contributed to the increased employment and labour force 
participation of workers aged 55 and above. Beyond policy reforms, structural changes such as 
improvements in health and education and shifts toward more flexible work arrangements have contributed 
to this trend. Advancements in healthcare and better living standards have led to improved health and 
increased life expectancy, enabling older individuals to remain active in the workforce for longer. A study 
focusing on Sweden highlighted that declining mortality rates among older age groups have allowed more 
individuals to continue working beyond traditional retirement ages (Laun and Palme, 2019[6]). 
The general rise in educational levels among older cohorts has also enhanced their employability. Better-
educated individuals are more likely to possess skills that are in demand, facilitating prolonged workforce 
participation (Allen, 2022[7]). The rise in educational attainment of older workers has narrowed their 
education gap with younger workers.4 This trend has been particularly pronounced for women. Between 
2000 and 2023 in the OECD, the share of women aged 55-64 with upper secondary or post-secondary 
non-tertiary education increased from 32.1% to 43.7%, while the share of college graduates rose from 
around 15.3% to 30.5% (OECD, 2024[8]). 
In many OECD countries, the shift from manufacturing to service-oriented economies has supported higher 
employment among older workers in recent decades (Autor and Dorn, 2013[9]). Service sector jobs are 
typically less physically demanding and rely more on cognitive skills, experience, and interpersonal abilities 
– skills that older workers often have. These roles also tend to offer more flexible working options, such as 
part-time or remote work options, which can be especially attractive to older adults. However, the transition 
is not without challenges. Some older workers may need to learn new skills, particularly in digital 
technology, and not all service sector jobs are high quality – many can be low-paid or insecure.

3.1.2. Employment rates lag behind for women, low skilled workers and those in poor 
health 
Despite the notable improvements in employment rates in recent decades significant disparities persist 
among various sub-groups of older workers, for example by gender, education and health status. The 
following key trends emerge: 
• 
Gender gaps in employment have narrowed across OECD countries since 2000. In 2000 the 
average gap in employment rates between women and men aged 55-64 was 23.2 percentage 
points and in 2024 this had fallen to 13.1 percentage points. However, narrowing the gender gap 
remains a key challenge across the OECD with gaps of over 32 percentage points in Costa Rica, 
Mexico, Colombia and Türkiye (Figure 3.2, Panel A). 
• 
Skills are a key factor driving employment and employability of older workers, with highly skilled 
individuals staying employed longer.5 In 2023, the average employment rate for people aged 55-64 
across the OECD was 50.4%, but was 76.7% for those with tertiary education – a gap of 
over 26 percentage points (Figure 3.2, Panel B). In countries such as the Slovak Republic, 
Luxembourg and Belgium, employment rates for less-educated older workers were between 32% 
to 37%, while in Iceland, New Zealand and the Netherlands, they reached 65-69%. Encouragingly, 
employment has increased for older workers at all education levels (Annex Figure 3.A.3), however 
those with higher education are still far more likely to remain in work beyond age 65 (Annex 
Figure 3.A.4). 
• 
Employment rates are consistently lower for individuals with long-term illnesses across all ages. 
Among those aged 55-64 with long-term illness, rates vary widely among the 23 countries with 
available data, from 22% in Luxembourg and 30% in the Slovak Republic to 75% in Sweden 
(Figure 3.2, Panel C). On average, the employment rate for this age group is 52%, compared to 
69% for those who do not report having a long-term illness. As populations age and chronic health 
conditions become more prevalent, addressing these disparities will be increasingly important. 
These results highlight the need for greater efforts to enhance the integration of older women. Persistent 
gender norms and caregiving responsibilities often hinders women’s labour force participation, especially 
for mothers. Women are more likely to have interrupted career trajectories due to caregiving earlier in life 
due to childbirth and also later in life due to adult caregiving (Maestas, Messel and Truskinovsky, 2024[10]; 
Van Houtven, Coe and Skira, 2013[11]). This often leads to fewer opportunities for promotions and lower 
lifetime earnings, which persist into older age. The gender pay gap generally widens with age, reducing 
the financial incentive for women to stay in employment. Additionally, many women work part-time, limiting 
their access to leadership roles and higher-paying positions. Older women also often face discrimination 
based on both age and gender (Lahey and Oxley, 2021[12]). While individual factors such as health, 
caregiving responsibilities, and personal preferences contribute to early retirement among women, joint 
decision-making within couples significantly can amplify this trend. Women are more likely to adjust their 
retirement timing to match that of their spouse (see for example García-Miralles and Leganza (2024[13])

One reason low-skilled workers have lower employment rates than more educated workers is the rise of 
automation and the growing demand for cognitive, technical, and digital skills. Many low-skilled jobs – such 
as clerical work, manufacturing, and basic customer service – are easily automated, leading to fewer job 
opportunities (Lassébie and Quintini, 2022[15]). These workers are also more likely to be in physically 
demanding jobs and tend to have poorer health and fewer years in good health. Low-skilled workers also 
face more barriers to reskilling and switching sectors, which further limits their job prospects (see 
Chapter 2).In contrast, higher-skilled workers are better able to adapt, as their jobs rely on problem-solving, 
creativity, and specialised knowledge – skills that are harder to automate (Lane, 2024[2]). 
Individuals in poor health encounter additional barriers such as physical limitations and workplace 
discrimination which have a detrimental effect on employment rates. Poor health also leads to absenteeism 
and lower productivity (Grinza and Rycx, 2020[16]). Moreover, inadequate workplace accommodations or 
flexible arrangements further limit the participation of workers with disabilities or long-term illnesses. 
Chronic illnesses or disabilities often result in early labour market exits, contributing to persistently low 
employment rates among this group (OECD, 2022[17]). A key challenge is that intervention often comes too 
late – many workers with disabilities have already experienced unstable employment histories or prolonged 
detachment from the labour market before receiving any formal support (OECD, 2022[17]). 
3.1.3. Once unemployed it is harder for older workers to get back into work and inactivity 
rises with age 
The level of unemployment among 50-64 year-olds is lower than the rest of the population (apart from 
those aged 65-69) (Figure 3.3, Panel A). Unemployment rates declined between 2000 and 2024 for most 
older workers. Among women, the unemployment rate fell by between 0.9 to 0 percentage points at ages 
50-64. Similarly, between the age of 50-64 men also saw declines in unemployment of 1-2 percentage 
points. However, among individuals aged 65-69, unemployment increased by 0.9 percentage points for 
men and 0.5 percentage points for women. However, although unemployment is a less frequent event 
among older workers, when it occurs, unemployment tends to be long-lasting (Annex Figure 3.A.5). 
Older workers often struggle to re-enter the labour market after experiencing unemployment, and inactivity 
tends to rise with age. A significant barrier is employer bias, as older workers are often perceived as less 
adaptable and lacking technological proficiency, which hurts their chances of being hired (Neumark, Burn 
and Button, 2019[18]). Long-term unemployment also leads to skill loss, making it harder to compete in a 
rapidly evolving labour market. On top of this, employers may see long unemployment spells as a sign of 
low motivation or productivity (D’hert, Baert and Lippens, 2024[19]). Being unemployment can also harm 
mental health and increase stress, creating a cycle that makes job searching even harder (Gedikli et al., 
2023[20]). Addressing these barriers – through reskilling programmes and countering age discrimination for 
example – is essential for helping older workers find new jobs.

Distinguishing between job displacement and general unemployment among older workers is crucial, as 
displacement is typically involuntary and driven by structural economic shifts, leaving workers unprepared. 
In contrast, general unemployment includes broader causes such as voluntary exits. This distinction is 
important for policy design, enabling targeted support for displaced older workers who often face longer 
joblessness and steeper wage losses. 
When older workers do experience job displacement, they face much greater challenges compared to 
younger workers: they spend more time unemployed, are significantly less likely to become reemployed, 
and when they do find new work, they typically suffer much larger wage losses – see for example OECD

(2018[21]); Jacobson, Lalonde and Sullivan, (1993[22]); Davis, Von Wachter and Hall (2011[23]). Additionally, 
many older workers are more likely to exit the workforce entirely, either because they see limited 
opportunities for advancement or opt for early retirement (Farber, 2017[24]). 
Concomitant with the rise in employment rates, inactivity rates have dropped substantially, particularly 
among women. For women aged 50-54, inactivity fell by 10.2 percentage points between 2000 and 2024, 
and even more for those aged 55-59 and 60-64, with drops of 18.4 and 23.3 percentage points, 
respectively (Figure 3.3, Panel B). Inactivity also fell by 13.1 percentage points on average for women 
aged 65-69. Men also saw similar improvements. However, there are large differences between countries, 
in Iceland, Japan and New Zealand, less than 30% of people aged 60-64 are inactive, compared to 
over 60% in Austria, Türkiye and Luxembourg (Annex Figure 3.A.6). 
Levels of inactivity also vary dramatically by qualification level and by gender across OECD countries. In 
2023 the average rate of inactivity for women aged 55-64 with qualifications below secondary level was 
54.6%, compared to 36.7% for men in this age and qualification group (Annex Figure 3.A.7). For women 
aged 55-64 rates of inactivity range from 36-41% in New Zealand, Sweden and Korea to over 70% in 
Türkiye, Poland and Costa Rica. In contrast rates are much lower for people with tertiary qualifications, but 
rates are on average almost double for women (26%) compared to men (16.5%). 
3.1.4. A lifecycle perspective is critical to supporting employment at older ages as being 
employed in your 50s is strongly correlated with employment in your 60s 
The employment patterns of people in their 50s are likely to have an important influence on their 
employment patterns in their 60s. On average across 25 European OECD countries and the United States 
for which there is available data, 59% of adults worked throughout their 50s while the rest were not 
consistently employed. On average about 30% of adults never worked during their 50s while the remaining 
11% experienced intermittent employment.6 On average across these OECD countries the likelihood that 
someone is employed at some point in their 60s is 69%, conditional on being steadily employed in their 
50s (Figure 3.4). In contrast only 8% of those who were never employed in their 50s were employed at 
some point in their 60s. Of those who were employed 80-99% of the time in their 50s (high intermittent), 
43% worked longer in their 60s, and 34% of those with low intermittent employment worked longer. 
This persistence is influenced by factors such as job stability, health, and financial needs. For women, 
childbirth can lead to career interruptions, making it challenging to re-enter the workforce and hindering 
their career advancement. Such interruptions often contribute to lower employment rates and earnings for 
women at older ages. Those who maintain steady employment at mid-career are better positioned to 
continue working later in life, while individuals who experience unemployment or job instability in their 
earlier years are more likely to retire or leave the workforce earlier. As mentioned above, unemployment 
can also be persistent. Older workers are less likely to become unemployed compared to their younger 
counterparts, but when they do lose their jobs, they face significantly higher risks of long-term 
unemployment. As a result, job loss in one’s 50s or 60s can have lasting effects on labour market 
attachment, income security, and retirement pathways. 
These results are also highly stratified by education. For those who were steadily employed in their 50s 
with tertiary education, 90% were employed at some point in their 60s (Annex Figure 3.A.8), this share 
falls to 60% for those with below upper secondary education who were nevertheless employed 
continuously in their 50s. A similar pattern emerges for those who had a high intermittent employment 
pattern in their 50s. The strenuousness of jobs among low-skilled workers resulting in more periods of 
sickness and difficulties in working until a later age may also play a role in explaining this pattern. For those 
who were employed 1-49% of the time in their 50s (low intermittent), the pattern reverses with those with 
low education being more likely to employed in their 60s (34%) compared to those with tertiary education 
(19%).

The relationship between experience of intermittent employment in one’s 50s and employment during 
one’s 60s is confirmed in regression analysis which allows further investigation of the factors that might 
account for the bivariate relationship shown above (Figure 3.5). Overall, employment stability in one’s 50s 
is strongly associated with working at age 62 (or age 63, if status at age 62 is not available). This is 
consistent with previous findings in the literature (Berkman and Truesdale, 2022[25]) and highlights the 
necessity of fostering employment opportunities at a younger age as a foundation for sustaining longer 
careers. People who have not been employed in their 50s (steady out) are 41 percentage points less likely 
to be employed at age 62 (relative to those in their 50s who were always in employment). In contrast those 
who were employed in their 50s between 80-99% of the time (high intermittent) were 10 percentage points 
less likely to be employed at age 62. 
Women, individuals without a college education, and those who report poor health are significantly less 
likely to remain employed in their 60s, even when considering their job status in their early 50s Since these 
groups already experience lower employment rates in their early 50s, this trend highlights a concerning 
expansion of employment disparities in mid-life. When factoring in employment status in the early 50s, 
women are 3 percentage points less likely than men to be working at age 62. For individuals without a 
college degree, the employment gap stands at 13 percentage points, while those reporting poor health in 
their early 50s also face a gap of 13 percentage points. Absent policy measures, labour market 
segmentation is further widening over the course of a career.

3.1.5. Good job quality is important for ensuring that older workers remain employed 
Job quality is a key factor in sustaining the employment of late career workers. Quality of work 
encompasses a range of factors, including earnings, autonomy, skill use, job security, working time 
arrangements, and workplace support. These dimensions are not only central to workers’ job satisfaction 
but are directly linked to health and employability in later life. Moreover, they have a direct impact on 
business performance, including productivity, profitability, and staff retention (OECD, 2023[26]). For older 
manual workers in particular, poor or deteriorating job quality significantly increases the risk of exiting 
employment, with negative mental and physical health acting as mediating factors (in Germany) (Stiller, 
Ebener and Hasselhorn, 2023[27]). In contrast, among non-manual workers, job quality work is less strongly 
associated with early exit from employment, suggesting that other factors may be more influential for this 
group (Stiller, Ebener and Hasselhorn, 2023[27]). This underscores the importance of tailoring interventions 
to specific occupational groups. 
Evidence shows that both higher own wages reduce quit rates as well, but that peer wages also have effect 
quit rates, specifically, if peers receive higher raises (while one’s own raise is lower), this increases the 
likelihood of quitting (Dube, Giuliano and Leonard, 2019[28]; Card et al., 2012[29]; D’Ambrosio, Clark and 
Barazzetta, 2018[30]). Additionally, self-reported job satisfaction has consistently been recognised as a 
strong indicator of employee separations and quits, independent of salary levels (Freeman, 1978[31]; Clark, 
2015[32]; Lévy-Garboua, Montmarquette and Simonnet, 2007[33]). 
Assessing the quality of working environments across countries is challenging due to the varied methods 
countries use to gather data and the general lack of comprehensive information on working conditions.

However, the European Working Conditions Telephone Surveys (EWCTS), conducted by Eurofound in 
2021, provide comparable data for 25 OECD European countries. According to the OECD’s conceptual 
framework, the quality of the working environment is evaluated based on the prevalence of job strain – 
define as a condition in which job demands (aspects of work that require continuous physical or mental 
effort and may harm well-being) outweigh the job resources (features of a job that can support motivation 
and coping mechanisms) available to workers (OECD, 2024[3]). On average for the 25 OECD European 
countries for which data are available, 9% of workers aged 55-64 experienced job strain in 2021, compared 
to 12% of those aged 30-54 and 13% of those aged 16-29 (Figure 3.6). A few countries clearly exhibit job 
quality that is better than others, with the share of strained workers aged 55-64 below 10% in Estonia, 
Portugal, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Hungary. In Sweden, the United Kingdom and Latvia the share of 
strained workers in this age group is 15% or above.

A safe and supportive work environment is crucial for maintaining workers’ health, reducing absenteeism, 
and sustaining productivity. High physical demands – such as heavy lifting, awkward postures, or fast work 
pace – are likely linked to early labour market exit (d’Errico et al., 2021[34]; Söderberg et al., 2021[35]; Stiller, 
Ebener and Hasselhorn, 2023[27]), while strong social support can help retain older workers. According to 
data from the OECD job quality database, exposure to physical risks (e.g. noise, chemicals) and demands 
(e.g. lifting loads) generally declines slightly with age. Only 17% of men aged 55-64 report high physical 
risks, compared to 23% of men aged 16-29 (Figure 3.7, Panel A). Similarly, exposure levels for older 
women decline from 28% at age 16-29 to 23% at age 55-64. Data for the United States from the 2015 
American Working Conditions Survey (AWCS), reveal that 55.5% of Americans aged 50-71 say their jobs 
involve exposure to physical risks such as vibrations from machinery, significant noise, extreme 
temperatures, breathing smoke or fumes or handling chemical products at least a quarter of the time 
(Maestas et al., 2017[36]).

Although older workers are generally less exposed to physical risks and demands, a substantial share still 
face high levels of exposure. Among workers aged 55-64, over 50% of health professionals, cleaners and 
helpers and personal care workers report significant physical risks (Figure 3.7, Panel B). These risks 
largely reflect the nature of the occupations with younger workers facing similar exposure in most 
occupations, however in many cases the exposure among older workers is substantially lower than for 
younger workers suggesting that the task content within these occupations differs by age group.

Career prospects, as measured by a specific module of the EWCTS, are available for a subset of 
respondents who were asked whether their job offers good opportunities for advancement. While career 
development is widely recognised as a lifelong process (Hunter‑Johnson et al., 2020[37]; OECD, 2024[38]), 
perceived opportunities decline with age. Just 22% of women and 30% of men aged 55-64 believe they 
have good advancement prospects, compared with 42% of men and women aged 16-29 (Figure 3.8, 
Panel A). In the United States, only 27% of workers aged 50-71 state that their job offers good prospects 
for career advancement, compared to 40% for those aged 35-49 and 50% for those aged 25-35 (Maestas 
et al., 2017[36]). 
Flexible working conditions are increasingly vital for supporting older workers across OECD countries. 
Flexible work arrangements can help older employees manage health concerns, caregiving 
responsibilities, and the transition into retirement, thereby enhancing their ability to remain in the workforce 
longer. Moreover, flexible work schedules contribute to improved job satisfaction and retention among 
older workers, benefiting both individuals and employers by maintaining a skilled and experienced 
workforce. In European OECD countries with available data, the availability of flexible working conditions 
tends to increase with age, at least for men; remaining relatively static for women (Figure 3.8, Panel B). In 
the United States, 37% of workers aged 55-71 report having the ability to adapt their hours within certain 
limits, which is very similar to that of younger workers (Maestas et al., 2017[36]). 
Figure 3.8. Career prospects, flexible working conditions and job autonomy are key aspects of job 
quality that vary significantly by age and gender 
 
Note: Data cover 25 European OECD countries. Sample includes employees only and excludes agriculture and armed forces. Good career 
prospects is based on those who respond strongly agree or tend to agree to the question “My job offers good prospects for career advancement”. 
Good work flexibility is based on those who respond very easily to the question “Would you say that for you arranging to take an hour or two off 
during your usual working hours to take care of personal or family matters is...?” High degree of autonomy is based on those who respond often 
or always to the question “In your main job, are you able to choose or change your methods of work”.

Autonomy and task discretion are vital components of job quality, particularly for older workers (OECD, 
2014[39]). Older workers typically experience greater autonomy than younger workers (Figure 3.8, 
Panel C). Research indicates that older employees who experience greater autonomy – such as control 
over work pace, methods, and scheduling – report higher job satisfaction and are more likely to remain in 
the workforce for longer. Maestas et al. (2023[40]) uses stated-preference experiments to elicit workers’ 
willingness to pay for different job attributes, and find that older workers prefer jobs with greater autonomy

(as measured by the ability to set their own schedule, work by themselves, etc.) as well as jobs that involve 
more moderate (relative to heavy) physical activity or more sitting. Moreover, autonomy allows older 
workers to leverage their experience and skills effectively, fostering a sense of purpose and engagement 
(Maestas et al., 2023[40]). Workers in the United States have a great deal of autonomy, with 73% of workers 
aged 55-71 reporting that they can choose or change their methods of work (Maestas et al., 2017[36]). 
Box 3.1. Jobs differ in how desirable they are for older workers 
While the physical intensity of jobs has a direct effect on workers’ ability to perform the job as they age, 
other job characteristics may also matter for worker motivation and indirectly affect labour productivity 
and employment rates. Older workers have been shown to value job amenities, such as lower physical 
intensity, flexible schedule and work autonomy, more than younger individuals. A move from the worst 
to the best job in terms of amenities has been estimated to be valued as equivalent to a 48% wage 
increase by 25-34 year-olds and a 75% increase by those aged 62-71 (Maestas et al., 2023[40]). 
The most significant differences in the willingness to pay for job attributes between the age groups were 
found for physical activity, with a move from a physically demanding job to one with moderate physical 
activity valued by 62-71 year-olds as equivalent to a 31% wage increase (9% for 25-34 year-olds). 
Schedule flexibility and work autonomy are also more valued at older ages – equivalent to a 15% and 
12% wage increase, respectively. Older workers also preferred to work alone and be evaluated based 
on their own work rather than the work of the team (Maestas et al., 2023[40]). 
These job attributes render some occupations more “age-friendly” than others. For example, 
occupations such as ICT professionals, Business & Administration professionals and Science & 
Engineering professionals are the most “age-friendly” not only because they do not require heavy 
physical activity but also because they allow workers to set their own schedules and plan their work 
(Annex Figure 3.A.9). In contrast, Food Preparation Assistants, Labourers in Industry, and Assemblers, 
the least “age-friendly” occupations on this metric, offer workers less flexible schedules and fewer 
opportunities to plan their own work. 
Over the last decades, occupations have become more accommodating to the preferences of older 
workers. Between 1990 and 2020, around three-quarters of occupations in the United States became 
more “age-friendly” (Acemoglu, Søndergaard Mühlbach and Scott, 2022[41]). Beyond the United States, 
the “age-friendliness” of jobs also increased in the last decade in most OECD countries (Figure 3.9), 
however, significant differences in the “age-friendliness” of jobs persist – see also Chapter 4.

Work capacity at older age has been rising over time, but uncertainties and inequalities 
remain 
Recent research on health and older workers provides nuanced insights into the evolving relationship 
between ageing, health status, and labour market participation. Evidence shows that there are significant 
improvements in the health of older cohorts (International Monetary Fund, 2025[42]; Kotschy, Bloom and 
Scott, 2024[43]; Lopez Garcia, Maestas and Mullen, 2025[44]). Across many countries, individuals in their 
60s and 70s are physically and cognitively more capable than earlier generations at the same age. For 
instance, the International Monetary Fund (2025[42]) finds that in a sample of 41 advanced and emerging 
economies, the cognitive capacity of a 70-year-old in 2022 was comparable to that of a 53-year-old in 
2000, a change associated with increased labour market attachment, hours worked, and earnings. 
Nonetheless, these benefits are unevenly distributed, with persistent disparities across countries and 
socio-economic groups. 
Lopez Garcia, Maestas and Mullen (2025[44]) offer a detailed account of work capacity based on the match 
between individuals’ functional abilities and job demands in the United States. They find that average 
abilities remain high and relatively stable up to age 70, especially in cognitive domains. Their “work 
capacity” metric – derived by aligning individual abilities with occupational requirements – shows that many 
older individuals retain the capacity to perform a large share of jobs, even if they report health issues by 
traditional metrics. Moreover, work capacity explains variation in labour force participation independently 
of standard health indicators, highlighting the importance of assessing ability-demand fit in employment 
policy for older adults.

In contrast, also for the United States, Cutler, Meara and Stewart (2025[45]) show that while work capacity 
remains relatively high for people in their early 60s, recent the United States’ cohorts are experiencing 
earlier onset of impairments – particularly in pain and cognition – than previous generations. These issues 
are more acute among individuals with lower education, with less than half of those without a high school 
diploma predicted to have the capacity to work full-time by age 62-64. Thus, although overall work capacity 
remains substantial, its distribution is becoming more unequal. Together, these studies suggest that while 
healthier ageing supports extended working lives, policies must account for disparities in health and ability 
across the workforce to be effective and fair. 
As workers reach 55, part-time work and self-employment become increasingly common 
Working time directly affects employees’ health and well-being, as well as being an important measure of 
labour utilisation (the intensive margin). Long hours increase the risk of health problems and exposure to 
workplace hazards. Striking a balance between work and personal life is especially important for sustaining 
motivation, capability, and engagement as workers grow older. In OECD countries, there has been a 
general decline in average annual hours worked over recent decades – see Chapter 1. On average across 
OECD countries there was a 3.5% decline in average usual hours worked for men aged 55-64 between 
2001-03 and 2021-23, and a 2.7% decline for women (Annex Figure 3.A.10). This is consistent with the 
overall decline in average usual hours worked of 3.2% for men and 1.6% for women aged 15-64. Korea 
has historically been among the OECD countries with the longest working hours but has witnessed a 
decline over this period in usual hours worked of 16.5% for men and 14.8% for women (aged 55-64), 
slightly below the decline for the population aged 15-64.7 
Transitioning to part-time work and self-employment is common among older workers. For women part-
time employment rises during the reproductive years – peaking at 33.7% on average among 
OECD countries with available data at age 39 – and then again at older ages to 64.7% on average by 
age 69 (Figure 3.10, Panel A). The share of men engaged in part-time work remains below 10% on 
average until age 55, before rising exponentially to reach 50.3% by age 69. The share of self-employment 
women rises sharply from age 60 to reach 27.9% by age 69, while for men the share who are self-
employment rises steadily from a young age to reach 44.7% by age 69. 
The motivations behind the shift to part-time work and self-employment are multifaceted. Many older 
individuals are drawn to part-time work and self-employment due to the flexibility and autonomy it offers, 
allowing them to adjust their work schedules and responsibilities to better align with personal preferences 
or health considerations (Ameriks et al., 2020[46]). This flexibility can be particularly appealing for those 
seeking to phase into retirement gradually or to remain active in the workforce without the constraints of 
traditional employment structures. Additionally, self-employment can serve as a viable option for older 
workers who face age-related barriers in the conventional job market, providing an alternative pathway to 
maintain income and engagement. 
Across all age groups, workers with lower educational attainment are more likely to be employed part-time 
due to the inability to secure full-time positions. Specifically, over 40% of workers aged 45-54 with low 
education levels work part-time for this reason, compared to 20% and 15% of their peers with middle and 
high education levels, respectively (Annex Figure 3.A.11). This disparity underscores the necessity of 
equipping workers, particularly those at risk of being stuck in poor-quality jobs, with the skills needed to 
advance to better employment opportunities. Older workers may encounter additional barriers in the labour 
market, such as difficulties in finding suitable positions, which must be addressed to facilitate effective 
career mobility.

Not all transitions to part-time work or self-employment are voluntary. A significant minority of workers 
across OECD countries take up part-time roles due to the lack of full-time opportunities. On average 
approximately 16% of men and 13% of women aged 55-69 working part-time do so because they are 
unable to find full-time employment (Figure 3.10, Panel B). The share is particularly high in Italy and Spain, 
where 54% and 52% of women aged 55-69, respectively, work part-time involuntarily. Among men, this 
reaches 55% in Italy and 48% in Spain. In addition, involuntary part-time employment disproportionately 
affects older workers in elementary, service and sales occupations (Figure 3.10, Panel C). This involuntary 
shift can lead to insufficient income and limited opportunities for wage growth, contributing to 
underemployment among this demographic (Bell and Blanchflower, 2021[47]). 
Given the high prevalence of self-employment among older workers, labour market policies should 
recognise the importance of diverse forms of work (such as temporary-work, agency-work, self-
employment and telework) in extending working lives. While self-employment offers valuable opportunities 
for older workers, it also carries risks. Since self-employed workers typically lack access to general public 
benefits like health insurance, pensions, and unemployment protections, they have to provide for such 
protection through their own financial arrangements (OECD, 2019[48]). Self-employment can often lead to 
difficulties such as securing adequate retirement savings and accessing affordable healthcare (Abraham, 
Hershbein and Houseman, 2021[49]). The absence of employer-sponsored benefits necessitates careful 
financial planning to ensure long-term security. Moreover, the success of self-employment ventures can 
be influenced by factors such as prior experience, industry knowledge, and the ability to adapt to changing 
market conditions (Abraham, Hershbein and Houseman, 2021[49]). More educated workers are much more 
likely to be self-employed compared to lower educated workers, often reflecting greater access to 
resources, networks, and autonomy – factors that contribute to disparities in labour market outcomes. 
However, among older adults, self-employment can also reflect constrained choices, particularly when 
driven by employer reluctance to hire older workers and a lack of flexible work options. Policies should be 
designed to provide older workers with as much choice as possible with regard to options such as part-
time work and self-employment by not advantaging or disadvantaging either regime economically. 
3.2. Strengthening incentives for longer working lives 
Over the past two decades, in response to an ageing population and the growing strain on pension 
systems, many OECD countries have raised statutory retirement ages, restricted access to early 
retirement schemes, and created incentives to work beyond traditional retirement ages. The purpose of 
these policy changes has been to improve the sustainability of public finances by extending working lives 
and reducing pension expenditures and to limit the negative impact of ageing on retirement income 
adequacy. 
Many of these reforms involve raising the statutory retirement age (SRA; the age set by law at which 
individuals are eligible to claim the state pension or public retirement benefits, either fully or partially) or 
early retirement age (ERA; the first age at which a pension can be claimed, often with reduced pension or 
benefits) to encourage longer workforce participation. Most recently, France has raised the minimum 
retirement age from 62 to 64 and will phase out some special pension schemes (OECD, 2023[50]). Sweden 
and the Slovak Republic strengthened the link between retirement age and life expectancy, a move now 
adopted by one in four OECD countries, including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Italy, the 
Netherlands and Portugal (OECD, 2023[50]). Costa Rica has increased the normal retirement age by 
three years for both men and women and restricted early retirement access. Czechia has reduced the 
window for early retirement from five to three years before the statutory age. In some cases, such as 
Denmark, Estonia, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, the normal retirement age could reach 70 years or 
more for the 2000 birth cohort if life expectancy continues to rise as projected and the legislated links with 
the retirement age are effectively implemented over time (OECD, 2023[50]). Denmark adopted a law in 
June 2025 to raise the retirement age to age 70 by 2040 for people born after December 1970.

The average labour market exit age increased in most countries between 2002 and 2022, by an average 
of 3.1 years for women and 2.6 years for men (Figure 3.11, Panel A), reaching an average of 63.1 years 
for women and 64.4 years for men in 2022 (Annex Figure 3.A.12). Estonia, Lithuania and Poland have 
recorded the largest increases in the average age of labour market exit for women, and Hungary, the 
Netherlands and Poland for men. For women the average age of labour market exit has declined in 
Costa Rica, Iceland and to a lesser extent also in Colombia, Luxembourg and Switzerland. For men there 
has been a decline in Colombia and Mexico. 
At current normal retirement ages (NRA; the eligibility age to pensions without penalty in all schemes 
combined after a full career from age 228) there remains significant scope for raising the average age of 
labour market exit without increasing the NRA, because the average age of labour market exit is below the 
current NRA in 25 out of 38 OECD countries for women (and in 23 countries for men) (Figure 3.11, 
Panel B). In these countries efforts could be made to raise the effective age of labour market exit through 
improvements in opportunities and employability (see subsequent sections) in addition to raising statutory 
retirement ages. In the remaining countries the average age of labour market exit is above the current 
NRA, for example in Türkiye where current NRA is 49 for women and 52 for men, while the average age 
of labour market exit is 60.2 and 61.5 respectively. 
Mandatory retirement rules give employers the option to end the contracts of workers at a certain age. 
These rules have become less common in recent decades but remain more common in the public sector 
than the private sector (OECD, forthcoming[51]). Currently, 18 out of 37 OECD countries for which there is 
available information have some form of mandatory retirement.9 Mandatory retirement across 
OECD countries takes various forms, differing in strictness and application (OECD, forthcoming[51]). In 
some countries like Finland and Luxembourg, particularly in the public sector, employment is legally 
terminated at a set age, though workers can be rehired. Most countries legally require public servants to 
retire at or after the normal retirement age, with Japan and Korea as exceptions. Many allow employment 
extensions based on need or performance. In the private sector, the most common approach allows – but 
does not require – employers to end employment at a certain age through contract clauses or reduced 
employment protections, as seen in countries like Germany, the Netherlands and France. Norway and 
Sweden have both types of systems, typically kicking in at or after the normal retirement age. Some 
countries, including Japan and Korea, also permit early termination or changes to employment conditions, 
such as reduced wages or reemployment under different terms, to encourage continued employment of 
older workers. 
Mandatory retirement is not a first-best policy instrument; it is often used to circumvent rigid employment 
and wage regulations, especially where seniority-based pay leads to a mismatch between wages and 
productivity or where dismissing underperforming workers is difficult. Rather than relying on mandatory 
retirement, these challenges should be addressed directly through targeted labour market reforms, such 
as more flexible wage-setting and dismissal procedures.

3.2.1. The labour market effects and behavioural responses of raising the eligibility age 
for pensions 
Pension reforms typically elicit a strong employment response 
Large employment increases have consistently been found in different countries in response to increases 
in both ERAs and SRAs.10 Pension reforms in the Netherlands gradually increased the statutory retirement 
age from 65 years in 2012 to 66 years and four months in 2019, resulting in a 21.2 percentage point 
increase in the employment rate (Rabaté, Jongen and Atav, 2024[52]). In Austria, increasing the ERA by

one year raised employment rates among affected men and women by approximately 9.8 and 
11 percentage points, respectively (Staubli and Zweimüller, 2013[53]). The employment response was 
strongest among high-wage and healthy workers, while low-wage and less healthy workers were more 
likely to seek alternative exit routes. In Germany, Geyer and Welteke (2021[54]) found a 13.5 percentage 
point increase in the employment rate for women following the abolition of the early retirement age for 
women in 1999. Reforms in Japan gradually increased the pensionable age for Employees’ Pension 
Insurance from 60 to 65, with evidence showing that each one-year increase in pension eligibility led to a 
7-8 percentage point rise in employment among affected individuals (Nakazawa, 2025[55]). In Denmark, 
reforms in 2011 delayed pension eligibility by six months, leading to increased labour force participation 
and delayed retirement (García-Miralles and Leganza, 2024[56]). 
Pension reforms affect not only individual retirement decisions but also those of spouses, such that policies 
targeting individual retirement behaviour can generate significant spillover effects within households. 
Research from Denmark, Norway and Switzerland shows that when once spouse becomes eligible for a 
pension, the other often adjusts their retirement timing as well – typically to retire together (García-Miralles 
and Leganza, 2024[13]; Lalive and Parrotta, 2017[14]; Johnsen, Vaage and Willén, 2022[57]; Kruse, 2021[58]). 
This joint retirement behaviour is largely driven by complementarities in leisure and shared financial 
planning. Evidence from Australia and Italy shows that raising pension ages can delay retirement for both 
spouses, supporting longer workforce participation for women (Atalay, Barrett and Siminski, 2019[59]; Carta 
and De Philippis, 2023[60]). 
There are several potential mechanisms driving these employment responses, however their relative 
importance is still not well understood and likely depends on institutional details and the characteristics of 
those nearing retirement (Coile et al., 2025[61]). Understanding the mechanisms through which pension 
reforms affect employment is essential for designing effective and fair policies. It helps policy makers 
anticipate how different groups will respond – whether due to financial need (credit constraints), reduced 
pension wealth (wealth effects), or behavioural norms. This allows reforms to be better targeted, reduces 
the risk of unintended hardship (especially for low-wealth individuals), and improves predictions of reform 
impacts across different contexts. It also has implications for understanding the distributional effects of 
changes to pension schemes which are important to understand in the context of the often-difficult political 
economy of reforms. 
Raising the retirement age can influence decisions to remain employed through income effects – such as 
reduced pension wealth prompting delayed retirement (Atalay and Barrett, 2015[62]). Employer demand 
also plays a role; for instance lifting mandatory retirement rules in France influenced employment patterns 
(Rabaté, 2019[63]). Credit constraints and wealth effects are key too. In the United Kingdom, increasing 
women’s early retirement age from 60 to 66 led to the largest employment gains among credit-constrained 
individuals, with a 13 percentage point larger increase than those not facing such constraints (Coile et al., 
2025[61]). Behavioural effects are also important – people are much more likely to retire at statutory 
retirement ages than at other points with similar financial incentives, suggesting strong social norms around 
these ages (Seibold, 2021[64]; Rabaté, Jongen and Atav, 2024[52]; Geyer and Welteke, 2021[54]; Coile et al., 
2025[61]; Gruber, Kanninen and Ravaska, 2022[65]). As a result, raising the statutory retirement age can 
lengthen working lives even without large financial incentives.11 Pension systems should therefore be 
designed with both financial incentives and behavioural factors in mind. 
Changes to pension policies should also consider the implications of longer working for physical and mental 
health. A key consideration with respect to changes in pension ages is health (Berkman and Truesdale, 
2022[25]; Berger et al., 2022[66]; Lopez Garcia, Maestas and Mullen, 2025[44]). While there is evidence on 
the effects of health on employment in later life – see for example Blundell et al., (2023[67]), there is also 
evidence that remaining in work as a result of delayed retirement has a strong causal impact on cognitive 
function and physical disability. For example, Banks et al., (2025[68]) leverage a pension reform in the 
United Kingdom that raised the State Pension Age between 2010 and 2017 for women aged 60-63. Using 
this natural experiment12 the study finds that continued employment significantly improves cognitive

performance (notably in memory and verbal fluency) and physical mobility (as measured by walking speed 
and reduced mobility problems). However, the effects are heterogenous across subgroups; the benefits 
are especially strong for single women and those in more physically active jobs. One implication of the 
above results is the role for policy in supporting transitions into types of work that are more conducive to 
the well-being of older workers. See for example Chapter 5 and OECD (2024[69]). 
There is little evidence of strategic take-up of disability or unemployment insurance by those 
affected by pension reforms 
Nevertheless, while the evidence suggests that raising retirement ages can be effective in extending 
working lives for those already employed, it has limited impact on individuals who are already in receipt of 
disability insurance (DI) or unemployment insurance (UI) or who have already exited the labour force. 
Therefore, pension reforms need to account for labour market conditions and access to alternative welfare 
programmes, recognising that those who are unable to continue working for longer are likely to access 
disability or unemployment insurance programmes, at least in the absence of concerted efforts to improve 
both the health of workers and job quality. 
Pension reform can generate two types of substitution effects, potentially leading to increased reliance on 
disability or unemployment insurance. Mechanical substitution effects occur passively as individuals 
remain longer in their pre-reform labour market state due to an increase in the SRA. In contrast behavioural 
substitution effects occur when individuals actively change their behaviour in response to the policy 
change, such as strategically entering DI or UI because they cannot continue working until the new 
retirement age. Evidence from a range of studies in different countries suggests that the substitution effects 
of recent pension reforms have been largely mechanical rather than behavioural. If workers had been 
strategically moving into DI to compensate for the higher SRA, then it would be possible to detect an 
increase in DI or UI claims before the old retirement age (i.e. before they were directly affected by the 
reform). 
For example, reforms in the Netherlands, led to a stepwise increase in the SRA from 65 years in 2012 to 
66 years and 4 months in 2019. Rabaté et al. (2024[52]) find that this led to a 60 percentage point decline 
in the share of people in retirement between the old and new retirement age. About a third of these people 
were employed (+21 percentage points), while another third (22 percentage points) were in social 
insurance (primarily disability insurance). Rabaté et al. (2024[52]) argue that these effects were mainly 
mechanical rather than behavioural – most workers simply remained in their pre-SRA labour market state 
longer and a significant concentration of retirements was observed at the new SRA (Rabaté, Jongen and 
Atav, 2024[52]).13 They find no significant effect of workers deliberately entering DI or UI as an alternative 
retirement pathway. In other words, the increase in DI claims was a natural consequence of raising the 
SRA, which forced some older workers – particularly those in poor health – to stay in the labour market 
longer and eventually transition to DI when they could no longer work.14 
Similarly, in Germany, Geyer and Welteke (2021[54]) find that the rise in unemployment and inactivity rates 
following the 1999 pension reform – which increased the ERA for women from 60 to at least 63 – was 
largely a mechanical effect. There is evidence of only a small amount of active substitution into 
unemployment, disability pensions, and inactivity. While unemployment rates rose by 5.2 percentage 
points, this increase was mainly due to women remaining unemployed longer rather than actively 
substituting from employment into unemployment. Geyer and Welteke (2021[54]) acknowledge that there 
were distributional consequences of the reform, noting that the main distributional effect of the reform was 
a result of the persistence of people in their current labour market status. They found that women in eastern 
Germany were more affected by the reforms and faced higher unemployment rates at ages 60-62 than in 
the west.15 
Nevertheless, understanding the substitution effects between pensions and DI is crucial when designing 
pension reforms. While restricting access to pension savings may extend working lives, it may also lead to

increased reliance on DI benefits. As the experience of Norway shows, allowing flexible pension 
withdrawals can also help reduce DI claims while still encouraging continued employment (Hernæs et al., 
2024[70]). Norway’s 2011 reform allowed some workers to withdraw their pension savings earlier, which 
significantly reduced DI claims. Access to own pension funds lowered entry into DI programmes after 
age 60 by as much as 20-25%. This suggests that workers who might otherwise have sought DI benefits 
due to financial constraints were able to rely on their pension savings instead. 
3.2.2. Pension reforms for those in hazardous jobs 
Workers in hazardous or arduous jobs are more likely to experience poor health, but relying on broad 
occupational categories to grant early retirement is increasingly viewed as ineffective. Many jobs have 
evolved thanks to technological change, and not all tasks within a given occupation remain physically 
demanding or dangerous. As a result, broad early retirement schemes risk being poorly targeted, offering 
benefits to individuals who may not face significant risks (OECD, 2023[50]). 
Where early retirement provisions remain necessary, such as for jobs involving acute physical and 
cognitive demands (e.g. police, firefighters, military), they should be narrowly targeted and evidence-based 
(OECD, 2023[50]). Innovations in some countries, like Austria and France, now link eligibility to specific job 
characteristics (such as night work) rather than job titles. A more sustainable and equitable approach 
involves redesigning workplaces, supporting career transitions, and promoting retraining, so that workers 
in difficult roles can stay active longer and retire in better health (OECD, 2023[50]). 
3.2.3. Flexible retirement may help facilitate longer working lives 
In the context of demographic ageing, pension systems and labour markets must adapt to support longer 
and more diverse working lives. One key response to this demographic shift is the promotion of flexible 
retirement pathways, which offer individuals greater choice in how and when to retire. These pathways 
enable older workers to gradually reduce their workload or combine part-time work with pension benefits, 
accommodating differing capacities and preferences as people age. 
A variety of flexible retirement options exist among OECD countries, including flexibility about when to 
retire via deferred retirement, differential pensionable ages, flexible pensionable ages, and early retirement 
(OECD, 2017[71]; Spasova, Deruelle and Airoldi, 2025[72]). The second main form of flexibility involves 
combining a pension with income from work. In this case three options are generally available i) claiming 
a full pension while continuing to work after reaching pensionable age, ii) claiming an early pension and 
continuing to work, and iii) claiming a partial pension and continuing to work part time (Spasova, Deruelle 
and Airoldi, 2025[72]). 
Flexible retirement schemes do not always have the effect of extending working lives.16 A review of partial 
retirement schemes in Europe in 2016 examined found no scheme unambiguously extended working lives 
for all participants (Eurofound, 2016[73]).17 The report found that the effectiveness of these schemes 
depends on factors such as the availability of early retirement options and scheme design, and concluded 
that partial retirement should be structured to be an “interesting” alternative to full early retirement while 
still incentivising full-time work whenever possible (Eurofound, 2016[73]). If implemented too early or with 
excessive working hour reductions, it may lead to an overall decrease in labour supply rather than 
extending working lives. This is consistent with an analysis of partial retirement in Germany which found 
positive labour supply effects when individuals have access to partial retirement from two years before the 
ERA, but if partial retirement is available too early (e.g. from age 60), it can crowd out full-time work and 
reduce total employment volume (Haan and Tolan, 2019[74]).18

Flexibility over when to retire 
Deferred retirement is the most common option, available in nearly all countries, allowing individuals to 
continue working beyond the pensionable age, often with financial incentives such as increased pension 
accrual rates (ranging from 3% to 10% per year) or lump-sum bonuses in some cases (Spasova, Deruelle 
and Airoldi, 2025[72]). These financial incentives are not generally designed to incentivise later retirement 
unless they are higher than what actuarial fairness requires. An actuarially neutral bonus/penalty is a matter 
of fairness: avoiding the situation where people retiring early receive lower lifetime benefits. However, they 
do remove disincentives to delay retirement – the lack of a bonus or penalty means that a person loses 
out if they do not take their pension at the earliest opportunity. 
Differentiated pensionable ages exist in many OECD countries and allow workers with long careers, 
particularly those in physically demanding jobs, to retire earlier without a pension reduction. Flexible 
pensionable ages, found in Finland, Sweden and Norway, allow individuals to choose their retirement age 
within a predefined range with actuarially adjusted benefits to encourage later retirement (Spasova, 
Deruelle and Airoldi, 2025[72]). For example, Norway’s 2011 pension reform introduced a flexible retirement 
age with actuarial (neutral) adjustment of the pension. Neutral withdrawal rules have also been seen as a 
prerequisite for freely combining work and pension without a reduction in the pension. Actuarially adjusted 
benefits also make it possible to allow for a free combination of income from work and pension without an 
earnings test. 
Combining work and pensions 
Promoting the combination of work and pension income has been a common reform among 
OECD countries in recent years. The simplest way to combine work and pensions is to claim a full pension 
at the normal or statutory retirement age while continuing to work part- or full-time, which is allowed in 
17 OECD countries. (OECD, forthcoming[51]). In comparison, Türkiye is the only OECD member where 
individuals are never permitted to receive a pension while continuing to work. Countries such as Canada, 
Czechia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia restrict people from working if they are receiving early-retirement 
benefits. These regulations effectively force individuals to choose between employment and pension 
income, creating a disincentive to remain in the workforce if the pension amount is enough to support their 
preferred lifestyle. 
However, the share of older workers who continue working on receipt of a pension is relatively low across 
OECD countries with available data. On average 21.7% of people aged 50-69 continued working at least 
part-time in 2023, 13.2% without making any changes, and 8.5% continuing to work with changes such as 
changing job, working fewer hours or continuing to work in a second job while stopping work in their main 
job (Figure 3.12, Panel A). Estonia (55%), Norway (47.6%) and Latvia (45%) are the countries with the 
highest share of people reporting that they continue some form of work, while the share combining work 
and pensions is lowest in Greece (4.4%), Croatia (5.2%) and Spain (5.6%).

Key motivations for continuing to work after receiving a pension include enjoyment of work and financial 
reasons (Figure 3.12, Panel B). For people aged 50-69 who combined work and pension receipt at the 
start of their retirement, the main motivation on average across the available countries was enjoyment of 
work and being productive (36.8%), followed by financial necessity (27.3%). Financial attractiveness of 
continuing to work was reported as the main reason by 8.6% on average, maintaining social integration by 
8.2%, while 2.4% continued to work because their partner was still working. 
Some countries do allow people to receive pension and labour income, but various conditions or limits 
apply (OECD, 2017[71]). This can include limits on hours worked or earnings or making employment less 
attractive by requiring people to make social security contributions without building up pension 
entitlements, such as in France, Greece and the Slovak Republic both before and after the normal

retirement age, as well as in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Spain after the statutory 
retirement age (OECD, forthcoming[51]). Australia has both earnings and assets tests for the Age Pension, 
and in Korea the basic old age pension is means-tested. However in many European OECD countries 
these types of restrictions have been removed (Spasova, Deruelle and Airoldi, 2025[72]; OECD, 2022[75]).19 
Some countries allow for claiming an early pension while continuing to work – this is allowed in 17 
European OECD countries, subject to a range of eligibility conditions such as age limit and/or income or 
hours of work limitations. Ten countries apply certain limits to the amount of work a person can do while 
receiving an early-retirement benefit (OECD, forthcoming[51]). 
Claiming a partial pension while continuing to work is also possible in some OECD countries, but this 
practice is less widespread. In Finland, from age 61, workers can claim 25% or 50% of their earned pension 
without any obligation to continue working; people can decide if they want to continue working either part-
time or full-time, or not at all. Evidence suggests that in general, partial retirement does not necessarily 
delay labour market exit (Hess, Bauknecht and Pink, 2018[76]; Baumann and Madero-Cabib, 2021[77]), 
however under specific conditions it might (Haan and Tolan, 2019[74]). Haan and Tolan (2019[74]) find that 
partial retirement increases the length of working lives when it is available from the early retirement age 
and designed to attract those who would otherwise retire early or exit via unemployment. It is most effective 
when combined with moderate pension payments during the partial retirement phase (e.g. 50%), which 
provide income support without heavily reducing future pensions. Crucially, such schemes should avoid 
encouraging full-time workers to reduce hours too early, and instead target those at risk of early labour 
market exit. 
In France, progressive retirement is available from age 60 for those with at least 150 quarters of social 
security contributions, allowing workers to reduce their working time by up to 80% while receiving a partial 
pension proportionate to the hours reduced (Spasova, Deruelle and Airoldi, 2025[72]). Austria is reforming 
its partial retirement scheme to discourage early exit from the labour market (OECD, 2025[78]). Currently, 
employees within five years of the statutory retirement age can reduce their working time by 40-60% with 
a 50% wage compensation for lost earnings, partly reimbursed to employers by the Public Employment 
Service. This can be done either continuously or via a block time model.20 However, from January 2024, 
public compensation for the block time model is being gradually phased out and fully eliminated by 2029. 
After that, only continuous part-time arrangements will be eligible for reimbursement – reinforcing the policy 
goal of extending working lives. 
To promote flexible retirement, pension policies should be closely linked with broader labour market 
measures that support older workers. This includes fostering age-friendly workplaces, expanding 
opportunities for training and upskilling, and encouraging flexible work arrangements such as part-time 
roles or remote work. Employers and social partners have a key role in ensuring a range of flexibility options 
(Box 3.2). At the same time, policies must recognise the diverse motivations for working longer – whether 
for financial reasons or personal fulfilment – by creating meaningful, flexible job opportunities that allow 
older workers to stay engaged and active. Governments should ensure that partial retirement is accessible 
to workers across different income and education levels, as lower-paid workers often need such flexibility 
but may struggle to afford it. 
Creating structured programmes that allow employees approaching retirement to gradually reduce their 
working hours or responsibilities can also support knowledge transfer and succession planning while 
accommodating employees’ desires for a gradual transition. Evidence indicates that phased retirement 
schemes, mentoring programmes, and intergenerational team structures are particularly effective in 
supporting such transitions (OECD, 2024[79]). For example, countries like Germany and Finland have 
implemented formal frameworks enabling older workers to transfer expertise through mentoring and 
coaching, while maintaining reduced roles. These initiatives not only preserve institutional knowledge but 
also improve job satisfaction and retention among senior staff.

Box 3.2. Creating more flexibility in retirement in Denmark 
In Denmark, collective bargaining agreements play a key role in supporting flexible retirement options. 
In the private sector, senior workers five years before the statutory pension age generally have access 
to senior leave days as part of the agreements. These can be financed through free choice wage 
schemes or by redirecting part of their pension contributions. 
Free choice wage schemes offer flexibility by allowing employees to allocate a portion of their earnings 
to extra pension contributions, direct salary, or paid leave. The leave can be used for various purposes, 
such as specific family-related needs or to finance senior leave days, subject to limitations set in the 
collective agreements. 
These schemes have been gradually expanded since 2007. In the 2025 private sector bargaining round, 
free choice contributions in the were increased by 2 percentage points. For example, workers covered 
by the leading manufacturing sector agreement will have a free choice account of 11% of their wage by 
2027. 
In the 2024 collective agreements in the public sector, a somewhat similar flexibility was introduced for 
state employees. These agreements allow state employees to use some of their mandatory pension 
contributions above 15% to purchase a higher degree of flexibility from their employers. Employees can 
choose to receive it as salary, have it allocated to a savings scheme linked to their pension, or opt for 
a combination of both. This allows individuals to tailor their benefits according to their financial 
preferences. In addition, employees have a new option to save up time off for later use, for example in 
connection with childcare, or caring for sick parents. The savings can consist of time off in lieu and 
special holidays. 
In the public sector senior days for workers close to retirement age have been part of the collective 
agreements for a longer time. They are not part of the new flexibility schemes. While both sectors now 
offer flexible retirement options, private sector schemes are typically broader and more established. 
Public sector arrangements are newer and apply to a narrower group but reflect a growing convergence 
in Danish retirement practices. 
Employers may also be hesitant to introduce partial retirement schemes due to concerns about anti-
discrimination laws as well as the perceived high costs of older workers (Johnson, 2011[80]). Employees, 
on the other hand, often worry about reduced pay, pension losses, or loss of benefits linked to full-time 
employment (Johnson, 2011[80]). 
Communication and planning play a vital role in a successful phased retirement scheme. Employers should 
proactively discuss phased retirement options with employees well in advance of their anticipated 
retirement age. Providing financial planning resources, workshops, and one-on-one consultations can help 
workers make informed decisions about their retirement transition. These discussions can also feature as 
part of a “mid-life career review” (OECD, 2024[38]). Financial literacy is crucial to ensure that individuals do 
not inadvertently reduce their pension benefits to unsustainable levels, highlighting the need for better 
education and transparency in pension systems (OECD, 2017[71]). 
3.3. Boosting the hiring and retention of older workers 
While better incentives are important to keep mid-to-late career workers working longer; they also need 
better opportunities to do so. Therefore, an important challenge for more inclusive ageing and employment 
policies is encouraging employers to both hire and keep mid-to-late career workers in good quality jobs.

Achieving this depends on how well companies handle age diversity and make the best use of all 
employees, regardless of their age. Government policies can play a role by influencing how employers 
approach the hiring and retention of mid-to-late career workers, ensuring the right balance between job 
flexibility and stability through labour market regulations. 
Hiring rates for older workers are influenced by several key factors. While wages and benefits typically rise 
with age, there is no conclusive evidence that productivity increases at the same rate (see also Chapters 2 
and 5), making employers cautious about hiring older workers. However, there is evidence which suggests 
that productivity can be enhanced through complementarities arising from multigenerational workforces 
(see Section 3.3.3). Some firms treat older and younger workers as substitutes, particularly where cost 
concerns dominate, while others see them as complementary, especially in roles requiring experience and 
knowledge transfer. 
Employers may also perceive higher transaction costs in hiring older workers due to concerns about 
adaptability, job tenure, and work environment accommodations. Age discrimination remains a significant 
barrier, particularly for older women (Neumark, Burn and Button, 2019[18]; Neumark, 2024[81]). 
Technological change further affects demand, with some firms reluctant to hire older workers if they are 
seen as less adaptable, though automation can sometimes complement their skills. Addressing these 
challenges requires firm policies that adjust compensation structures, enhance training, and combat 
age-related biases in hiring. 
Hiring rates decline with age, with 9.5% of employees aged 55-64 being newly hired in 2022, compared to 
11.8% for those aged 45-54 and an average of 15% for workers aged 35-44 (Figure 3.13, Panel A). The 
decline with age likely reflects a combination of demand side factors, and also supply-side factors if older 
workers exhibit less inclination to change jobs, or possibly due to a desire for stability, satisfaction with 
their current roles, or concerns about facing age discrimination in new workplaces. Further, there has 
generally been no improvement in hiring rates over the last 25 years for older workers (Annex 
Figure 3.A.13, Panel B).21 Some countries such as Korea and Türkiye do have high hiring rates, however 
this may partly reflect low retention rates (Figure 3.13, Panel B). 
3.3.1. Keeping people at the end of their career is difficult 
Job retention is critical for extending working lives – by allowing older workers to continue using their 
experience and firm-specific skills (OECD, 2023[26]). Retaining workers in their current roles can offer 
stability, foster productivity, and reduce the costs associated with turnover. On average across the OECD, 
just over half of working 55-59 year-olds leave their employer by the time they are 60-64 (Figure 3.13, 
Panel B). This compares to an average of 34.6% of 40-44 year-olds who leave by the time they are 45-49. 
Although older workers have relatively long average tenure, by the time they reach their fifties, the 
likelihood that they will continue in the same job falls dramatically. Moreover, substantial differences 
emerge across countries. In Korea, Austria, Türkiye, Luxembourg and Slovenia, fewer than 40% of workers 
aged 55-59 remain with their current employer after five years, although to some extent this will reflect 
relatively low retirement ages and either workforce exit or rehiring or job change in the case of Korea. By 
contrast, in Iceland, Portugal, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Germany, over 65% of workers in this age 
group are still in the same job five years later.

3.3.2. Overcoming age discrimination in the workplace 
Age discrimination in the labour market remains a significant barrier to employment for mid-to-late career 
individuals, despite legislative efforts to combat it in most OECD countries (Figure 3.14). Ageism can be 
institutional, interpersonal or self-directed. Resume audit studies have consistently shown that older job 
applicants often receive fewer interview invitations compared to their younger counterparts with equivalent 
qualifications (Neumark, Burn and Button, 2019[18]; Neumark, 2024[81]; Carlsson and Eriksson, 2019[82]; 
Oesch, 2020[83]). These field experiments reveal strong employer biases against older workers, particularly

women and those nearing retirement age, and highlight how age-based discrimination can occur even 
before employment begins. 
This raises further concern about policies that remove employment protection once pension age is 
reached, potentially legitimising similar biases at the point of job exit. Evidence from France, the 
Netherlands and Sweden shows that lifting employment protection legislation (EPL) at or after full pension 
age facilitates de facto age-based termination discrimination. In France, Rabaté (2019[63]) finds that 
employers use mandatory retirement provisions to dismiss older workers with reduced legal risk, 
accounting for a significant portion of the spike in retirements at full pension age. In the Netherlands, 
Rabaté, Jongen and Atav (2024[52]) show that the statutory retirement age marks a sharp increase in job 
exits due to automatic termination rules, with employer-side factors driving the bunching. In Sweden, Saez, 
Schoefer and Seim (2024[84]) provide clean causal evidence that removing EPL at age 67 leads to a 10% 
drop in employment and largely involuntary separations, especially targeting vulnerable groups. 
There is compelling evidence that age-stereotyped language in job ads – especially phrases implying 
deficiencies in health, personality, or technological skills – can deter older workers from applying for jobs 
and is associated with actual age discrimination in hiring (Burn et al., 2022[85]; Burn et al., 2022[86]). For 
employers, this highlights the legal and practical risks of using language that may inadvertently signal age 
bias, potentially excluding qualified older candidates and violating age discrimination laws. Employers can 
audit and revise job postings to ensure they are age-neutral, particularly in references to traits like 
adaptability, energy, or tech-savviness. From a policy standpoint, these findings support stronger 
regulatory oversight by governments or equality bodies. This could include clearer guidance on how to 
advertise in an age-neutral way and broader educational campaigns to counteract workplace age 
stereotypes. 
Self-directed ageism can be as equally harmful as institutional and interpersonal ageism, and occurs when 
individuals internalise societal ageist attitudes, modifying their own beliefs and behaviours in ways that 
reinforce negative stereotypes about ageing. This can arise from repeated exposure to cultural narratives 
that portray ageing as synonymous with decline, reduced productivity, and diminished cognitive ability. 
Research suggests that older individuals may unconsciously adopt these views, leading them to 
underestimate their capabilities, withdraw from opportunities for career advancement, and disengage from 
training or development programmes (Centre for Ageing Better, 2023[87]; Vickerstaff and van der Horst, 
2022[88]). 
The consequences of age discrimination are multifaceted. For individuals, it can result in prolonged 
unemployment, underemployment, and financial insecurity during what should be their peak earning years. 
Older workers who internalise negative stereotypes may experience decreased self-confidence, 
heightened stress, and reluctance to seek employment or professional growth. This can lead to premature 
workforce exits, reinforcing the economic and social challenges associated with ageing populations. 
Further, self-directed ageism has been linked to negative health behaviours, such as avoiding preventive 
healthcare or exercise, which in turn contribute to poorer health outcomes and increased reliance on social 
care (Centre for Ageing Better, 2023[87]). For businesses, excluding experienced workers results in a loss 
of valuable skills and knowledge, potentially decreasing overall productivity.

Most OECD countries have implemented laws to prevent age discrimination in hiring, along with various 
initiatives aimed at shifting employer attitudes toward older workers. Evidence shows that laws protecting 
older workers from age and disability discrimination can reduce age discrimination in hiring (Neumark, 
2020[89]). In a large-scale field experiment, Neumark (2019[90]) found that states in the United States with 
more stringent age discrimination laws – particularly those allowing larger damages – tend to show reduced 
discrimination in hiring, as measured by callback rates for older applicants. However legal measures often 
fall short due to weak enforcement and the financial or procedural challenges individuals face when 
pursuing discrimination claims in court (OECD, 2019[5]).22 
Addressing self-directed ageism requires both systemic and individual-level interventions. Employers can 
play a crucial role by fostering age-inclusive workplaces that challenge stereotypes, ensuring access to 
training for older workers, and promoting lifelong learning (Vickerstaff and van der Horst, 2022[88]). On an 
individual level, raising awareness of how ageist narratives shape self-perception can help older workers 
reframe their understanding of their own capabilities. Broader cultural change, including shifts in media 
representation and public discourse around ageing, is also essential to reducing the prevalence of ageist 
beliefs and their damaging consequences (Henry et al., 2023[91]). 
A key aspect of promoting age diversity is ensuring best practices in recruitment, retention, and retirement. 
Tools such as the Good Recruitment for Older Workers (GROW) toolkit developed in the United Kingdom 
can be used by businesses as a starting point for reducing age bias in recruitment practices (Box 3.3). 
Approaches such as skills-based hiring – prioritising an individual’s capabilities and competencies over 
formal qualifications or chronological factors like age – can also potentially help address age discrimination 
in the workplace. However, at this point there is no available evidence on how skills-based hiring affects 
discrimination. Further, some employers may still retain biases, and automated hiring tools could 
inadvertently discriminate against older workers if the underlying algorithms or data reflect existing 
biases (Butrica and Mudrazija, 2022[92]; Broecke, 2023[93]).

Box 3.3. Good Recruitment for Older Workers (GROW) Toolkit 
The GROW toolkit, developed by the Centre for Ageing Better, the CIPD (Chartered Institute of 
Personnel and development) and Recruitment and Employment Confederation in the United Kingdom, 
provides employers with practical strategies to reduce age bias in recruitment processes and create 
multigenerational workplaces. Strategies discussed in the toolkit include developing recruitment 
processes that minimise both explicit and implicit age biases. This includes debiasing job 
advertisements by using age inclusive language, and adopting recruitment practices such as blind 
applications, clear interview guidelines, and reasonable adjustments for candidates’ needs. Fostering 
a workplace culture that values age diversity is also recommended to raise awareness and build 
confidence among staff. This can be achieved by training employees to recognise and challenge 
age-related biases, and encouraging intergenerational collaboration, for example.

A key factor influencing employers’ demand for older workers is how compensation costs and productivity 
evolve with age. Empirical evidence indicates that while older workers often bring extensive experience 
and stability to a firm, there is no consistent correlation between age and productivity. Studies using 
matched employer-employee data across various countries offer mixed findings. For instance, some 
studies show that firms with a higher share of older workers experience lower productivity, while others 
find no significant relationship or even slightly positive effects in specific contexts (Hellerstein and Neumark, 
1995[95]; Cardoso, Guimarães and Varejão, 2011[96]; Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske, 1999[97]; 
Haltiwanger, Lane and Spletzer, 2007[98]; Mahlberg et al., 2013[99]; Daveri and Maliranta, 2007[100]; Göbel 
and Zwick, 2012[101]).23 
Additionally, these studies often conflate two distinct effects: the individual productivity of workers and the 
complementary effects of co-workers. OECD evidence shows that workers of both younger and older age 
groups tend to be more productive when they work in companies with a greater number of colleagues from 
the other age group (Figure 3.15). Workers aged 50 and above demonstrate productivity levels 
comparable to those of individuals aged 35-49, and they perform better when they work alongside more 
younger colleagues (OECD, 2020[102]). Organisations with a 10% higher share of workers aged 50 and 
over than the average are 1.1% more productive (OECD, 2020[102]). This is due to a direct effect of 
proportionately fewer younger workers and a positive spillover effect from a higher share of older workers. 
This boost stems from the complementarities between age groups, specifically that older workers have 
lower worker turnover, greater management experience, and greater general work experience (OECD, 
2020[102]).

However, irrespective of the empirical evidence, employer perceptions of the productivity of older workers 
are also critical from the perspective of labour demand. Results from a recent OECD/Generation 
survey (OECD/Generation: You Employed, Inc., 2023[103]) find that while employer perceptions of the 
strengths of job candidates vary significantly by age (Figure 3.16, Panel A).24 the actual job performance 
of mid-to-late career workers hired in entry or intermediate level jobs (following a change in occupation) is 
seen as at least as good or better compared to younger hires (Figure 3.16, Panel B).

Note: In Panel A, respondents were asked, “Think about the applicants you have reviewed for entry- and intermediate-level positions. Which 
candidates are the most likely to…” followed by ten different potential candidate job strengths. Respondents were able to select only one age 
group (20-29 year-olds, 30-44 year-olds, 45-54 year-olds, 55-65 year-olds) as the response for each portion of the question. Data for 45-65 
displayed above is the sum of responses from respondents where 45-54 year-olds and 55-65 year-olds were selected as the most likely group 
to display the respective traits. In Panel B, respondents were asked, “Once hired, how do midcareer switchers perform on these dimensions 
compared to other entry-level or intermediate-level hires?” followed by four areas to evaluate (overall job performance, ability to learn quickly, 
potential to stay with your company long-term, amount of support needed when entering the role.

3.3.4. Aligning wages with performance, not age 
Aligning wages more closely with productivity rather than age or seniority in collective bargaining 
agreements could increase demand for older workers and reduce ageism in hiring. In many 
OECD countries, seniority-based pay structures result in wage profiles that rise steeply with age and tenure 
regardless of actual productivity. This wage-productivity mismatch often discourages employers from 
retaining or hiring older workers. Evidence from countries such as Germany illustrates that moving away 
from automatic seniority pay has contributed to improving employment outcomes for older workers.

German firms increasingly adopt performance-related or task-based pay scales, which better reflect the 
actual contributions of workers rather than their length of service (OECD, 2019[5]). 
Conversely, in Japan and Korea, seniority-based systems remain deeply embedded in labour market 
practices. This is reflected in both countries’ persistent challenges with older worker retention. In Japan, 
although legislative measures have extended the mandatory retirement age, many firms continue to rehire 
older workers at substantially reduced wages, reflecting their diminished bargaining position rather than 
their productivity (OECD, 2018[104]). Korea faces similar issues, with older workers disproportionately 
pushed into low-quality or non-regular employment despite high participation rates. Here, steep 
age-related wage premiums contribute to early separations from regular employment, creating financial 
insecurity and exacerbating old-age poverty risks (OECD, 2018[105]). 
Replacing seniority-based wage systems with productivity-aligned remuneration frameworks is a critical 
step toward the goal of continued labour force participation. Performance-related pay, unlike seniority-
based pay, ties financial rewards directly to an individual’s performance, often using measurable targets 
or assessments. However, to be effective, performance-related pay must be designed with care. Evidence 
suggests that both financial incentives and non-financial recognition can significantly improve motivation 
and performance, but only when they are perceived as fair, linked to clear standards, and embedded within 
supportive management (Cotton, 2022[106]). 
3.4. Promoting the employability of workers throughout their working lives 
Promoting employability throughout life is essential for improving job opportunities for mid-to-late career 
workers. While some mid-to-late career workers thrive in the labour market, others face challenges due to 
outdated or insufficient skills, lack of experience in job search or poor health. To support longer careers, 
mid-to-late career workers need opportunities to develop relevant skills and work in environments that 
promote well-being, health, and productivity. Policies to improve the skills and training of mid-to-late career 
workers are discussed further in Chapter 4. 
3.4.1. Supporting employers in introducing age management practices in the workplace 
As workforces age and become more multigenerational, employers need support to implement effective 
age management practices. Adopting a comprehensive approach that covers work organisation, training, 
health, and working time can help workers remain in employment and sustain or improve their productivity. 
Many companies, particularly SMEs require support and consultation in the development of age 
management practices in the workplace. Investing in effective firm management is essential, as without it, 
efforts to enhance hiring practices, training, or workplace health policies will likely fall short. Quality 
management practices, such as continuous improvement, monitoring key performance indicators, and 
focusing on employee development, can significantly boost firm productivity, raise wages, and reduce quit 
rates (Hoffman and Tadelis, 2021[107]; Friebel, Heinz and Zubanov, 2021[108]; Moscelli, Sayli and Mello, 
2022[109]). However, smaller businesses often lack the formal management systems common in larger 
firms, potentially limiting their capacity to grow and compete. In some countries the PES is supporting 
companies to improve age management practices (Box 3.4). 
For employers, implementing and maintaining high-performance work practices (HPWPs) can be an 
effective HR strategy to retain older workers and delay retirement (Stirpe, Trullen and Bonache, 2018[110]; 
Jiang et al., 2022[111]). HPWPs – comprising skill-, motivation-, and participation-enhancing practices – help 
meet older workers’ needs for autonomy, purpose, and respect, encouraging them to stay longer in the 
workforce. Jiang et al. (2022[111]) found that in the United States, high-involvement work practices are 
associated with lower retirement intentions, particularly when they align with older workers’ intrinsic 
motivations and work values. Analysis by Stirpe et al. (2018[110]) using data from the United Kingdom note 

--- Page Break ---
170    
OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
that while the retention benefits of HPWPs may diminish somewhat with age due to increased sensitivity to 
job demands, age-aware design of such practices can still support engagement and reduce early retirement. 
Evidence shows that organisations should aim for integrated and age-inclusive HR strategies that balance 
the needs of all age groups and foster an inclusive culture (Boehm, Schröder and Bal, 2021[112]). 
Box 3.4. Supporting age management in firms in Austria 
Impulse consulting for companies helps employers in strategic personnel management 
Since 2015 the Austrian Public Employment Service offers free consulting to Austrian companies of all 
sizes (OECD, 2025[78]). The aim of the “Impulse Consulting for Companies” (Impulsberatung für 
Betriebe) programme is to assist companies with challenges related to personnel management. Impulse 
consulting for companies in the area of age(ing)-appropriate workplaces can focus on age-specific 
hiring practices, redesign of jobs and workplaces, working time policies, intergenerational knowledge 
transfer, health management practices and training measures. Evaluation of the programme found that 
the consulting service is associated with changes in HR practices in participating companies. Relative 
to a control group, these companies were relatively more likely to hire low-qualified workers, women, 
and workers over the age of 45, with the share of companies hiring older workers being 5 percentage 
points higher than in the control group. 
Demographic consulting to create an age-appropriate digital work environment 
Demographic consulting Digi+ (Demografieberatung Digi+) is a free consulting service for the creation 
of age-diverse and digitalised workplaces in Austria. Companies can benefit from comprehensive 
advice along five key areas (work design, leadership and culture, personnel management, knowledge 
and skills, health) to create an age-appropriate digital work environment. 
3.4.2. Employee-oriented flexible working conditions help workers stay in employment 
Older workers show a strong preference for jobs with greater flexibility in work schedules and less 
burdensome work. Ameriks et al. (2020[46]) found that about 60% of non-working respondents, mostly in 
their late 60s or 70s, would be willing to return to work if offered a flexible schedule. This preference for 
flexibility is consistent with actual labour market transitions, as shifts to part-time, self-employment, 
temporary jobs or bridge jobs (jobs taken after retirement from a career job) are common as people age 
(Abraham, Hershbein and Houseman, 2021[49]). Offering a range of options, such as reduced hours, job 
sharing, remote work, or consulting opportunities, allows employees to tailor their transition according to 
their financial and personal circumstances. Employers should establish clear policies on eligibility criteria 
and workload expectations to avoid confusion and ensure consistency across the organisation. 
Overall, evidence suggests that flexibility can have a positive effect on work-life balance, job satisfaction 
and productivity for older workers. Flexible work arrangements can enhance productivity in two ways: by 
attracting more productive workers and by incentivising workers to exert more effort or time. A recent field 
experiment found that offering a full-time flexible contract rather than a full-time non-flexible one can 
increase a worker’s overall productivity by nearly 50%, with about 40% of this effect attributed to attracting 
more productive workers (Boltz et al., 2020[113]).25 
Employee-oriented flexible working arrangements can be supported by governments, employers and 
social partners. Recent reforms in the United Kingdom have led to the introduction of the right to request 
flexible working from the first day of employment, rather than after 26 weeks of continuous employment, 
where flexible working can cover options such as remote or hybrid work, job sharing, compressed hours, 
staggered hours and part-time work.

3.4.3. Greater policy effort is needed to support women’s employment 
Motherhood has a substantial negative impact on women’s career prospects, affecting both their earnings 
and opportunities for advancement throughout the rest of their life, thereby affecting their job prospects in 
later life – a phenomenon widely known as the “motherhood penalty” (Healy and Heissel, 2020[114]; Kleven 
et al., 2019[115]; Barth, Kerr and Olivetti, 2021[116]; Goldin, Kerr and Olivetti, 2022[117]). This penalty stems 
from a combination of direct employer discrimination and indirect effects such as reduced working hours 
or career interruptions due to childcare responsibilities, which are particularly common among women with 
low to medium skill levels, partly because the financial cost of leaving work is lower (OECD, 2021[118]). 
The negative effects of motherhood on employment and earnings are often compounded later in life by the 
demands of informal caregiving for ageing parents or partners – a role taken on by 13% of people aged 50 
and above in OECD countries, of whom 62% are women group (OECD, 2021[119]). Informal caregiving is 
associated with lower employment rates and earnings, particularly for women and older workers (Maestas, 
Messel and Truskinovsky, 2024[10]), and many caregivers continue to face employment challenges and 
reduced earnings even after their caregiving duties end (Vangen, 2021[120]). 
Efforts to increase labour force participation, particularly among women, must carefully consider the 
trade-offs between paid employment and unpaid care work. While integrating more women into the 
workforce is crucial, it often leads to a reallocation of time from essential, yet unpaid, caregiving 
responsibilities to paid labour – see Chapter 2. This shift can have unintended consequences, especially 
if care work remains undervalued in economic terms. 
To address these disparities, workplace reforms that promote flexibility, such as job-sharing and 
predictable scheduling, can help balance professional obligations with caregiving duties. The high cost of 
childcare and long-term care in many countries can prevent women from re-entering the labour force or 
lead women to leave current positions in search of more flexible working arrangements. More generous 
support for childcare, such as public provision or subsidies plays a key role in supporting female labour 
force participation (Canaan et al., 2022[121]; Farré and González, 2019[122]; Albanesi, Olivetti and 
Petrongolo, 2022[123]).26 
Evidence suggests that greater parental leave sharing can improve family well-being and female 
employment outcomes. Although fathers’ uptake of leave remains low across OECD countries, paternity 
leave has significant benefits: it helps mothers return to work without reducing fathers’ labour market 
participation (Farré and González, 2019[122]; Rønsen and Kitterød, 2014[124]). Fathers who take leave are 
also more likely to engage in childcare and household duties, strengthening family dynamics and 
challenging traditional gender roles work (Korsgren and van Lent, 2022[125]). Reflecting these benefits, 
many OECD countries have introduced reforms to promote fathers’ leave. While only seven countries 
offered paternity leave in 1995, by 2020 this had increased to 34 (OECD, 2022[126]). Countries such as 
Estonia, Greece and Canada provide specific entitlements or incentives for fathers, and others, including 
Norway and Iceland, have introduced individual non-transferable leave to encourage equal sharing. 
3.4.4. Job and career mobility can play a key role in supporting employment at older 
ages 
However, not all jobs remain a good fit as people age. For workers facing health challenges, limited 
advancement opportunities, or poor job quality, mobility can provide a pathway to more suitable and 
sustainable employment. Voluntary job changes later in life are associated with improved job satisfaction, 
flexibility, and, in some cases, higher wages. However, job mobility declines significantly with age, with 
only 6% of workers aged 45-64 changing jobs annually, compared to 17% of younger workers (OECD, 
2024[69]). Yet, without targeted policies, many older workers remain trapped in low-quality jobs, with 60% 
of low-skilled workers aged 45-64 who change jobs moving into another low-skilled position, limiting their 
career progression and wage growth (OECD, 2024[69]).

172    
OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
Governments and employers have a role to play in facilitating career transitions for older workers. Effective 
policies include targeted career counselling and retraining programmes, such as Australia’s Career 
Transition Assistance Program, which supports people 45 years and over to build their job search and 
digital literacy, identify existing transferable skills and develop a plan to change careers. Employer-led 
initiatives, such as mid-career reviews, have also proven effective in helping workers reflect on their career 
options and plan for later-life transitions. These policies collectively lower barriers to mobility, enabling 
older workers to remain in the workforce for longer while ensuring their jobs align with their skills and 
aspirations – see also Chapter 4. 
3.4.5. Early interventions are crucial to prevent workers with disabilities from exiting the 
labour market 
As life expectancy has increased in recent decades, many individuals now enjoy longer periods of good 
health, nevertheless with advancing chronological age, the likelihood of experiencing health issues rises. 
Older adults are more susceptible to chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, 
which can impact their quality of life and ability to continue in their current work roles. Implementing early 
support measures can help workers with disabilities stay employed. Notably, certain demographics, 
including women and those with limited education, experience higher rates of disability. While social 
protection is essential for assisting older workers with health problems, it may inadvertently discourage 
continued employment and self-reliance. Extended periods away from work can lead to skill deterioration 
and increased detachment from the labour market. Therefore, interventions should focus on early support 
strategies that facilitate rehabilitation and a gradual return to work. 
Labour force survey data provide insights into the main reason why people left their last job for those who 
are currently unemployed.27 Among workers aged 55-64 in OECD countries for which there is available 
data, 47% of people who were no longer in employment left their last job to retire (on average), while a 
further 17% left due to illness or disability (Figure 3.17). However this data needs to be treated with caution 
as in some countries such as Austria, France and Slovenia people retiring on disability benefit are likely to 
classify themselves as retired, not as disabled. Among those aged 45-54, 22% cited illness as the main 
reason for leaving their last job. In Denmark, Belgium and Norway more than 40% cite illness as the main 
reason (Annex Figure 3.A.14).

Effective return-to-work programmes can enhance employability for workers requiring additional 
assistance in finding suitable job matches (OECD, 2023[127]). These programmes may address health-
related barriers through regular consultations with caseworkers and employees, medical rehabilitation 
(e.g. psychological counselling, health management courses), or work-related obstacles via traditional 
labour market activation policies (e.g. career counselling, training programmes, work experience). 
Although younger workers are more likely to engage in these vocational programmes, older participants 
have comparable success rates in returning to work (OECD, 2023[127]). Additional early intervention 
methods include involving employers in monitoring processes, graded return to work, and allowing partial 
sickness benefits for part-time work (Box 3.5). 
Ongoing support during the transition back to work is also crucial to prevent workers from facing 
deteriorating conditions that may lead to premature labour market exit. Investing in successful transitions 
is essential; without continuous support, workers may develop new disabilities that force them out of the 
labour market, negating the economic benefits of initial interventions. Incorporating continuous monitoring 
and support services, such as those provided by Australia’s Disability Employment Services programme, 
can help prevent the worsening or emergence of new health issues (OECD, 2024[69]).28

Box 3.5. Early intervention health programmes 
Capacity-oriented sickness certificates in the Netherlands 
In the Netherlands, employers and employees are obliged and have strong incentives to follow a defined 
return-to-work track with fixed milestones and dates (OECD, 2023[127]). Within six weeks of sickness, 
employees need to see a social insurance or occupational physician for a remaining work-capacity 
assessment. Within eight weeks, the individual employer and employee must write an action plan how 
both parties can promote return to work. This includes the obligation to examine whether a return to the 
previous job, or to the same company but another job, is possible and if so, under which conditions 
(e.g. with an adjusted workplace or schedule, or with graded work). The parties must reassess 
remaining work capacity every six weeks. About three-quarters of employers have insured themselves 
against the risk of continued wage payments via private insurers (Kools and Koning, 2019[128]). These 
private insurers can facilitate return to work further. All involved actors have strong incentives to 
co-operate. Employees on employer-provided sick pay (which, in the Netherlands, is paid for two years) 
have legal obligations to collaborate, with the risk of dismissal and losing eligibility to employer-provided 
sick pay and disability benefits. Employers have long and expensive employer-provided sick pay 
obligations that can be further extended (by yet another year) in case of non-compliance with their 
obligations. They also face experience-rated disability benefit costs after employer-provided sick pay. 
The private insurer has a direct financial incentive to stimulate return to work to lower insurance 
payments. 
Graded return to work in Norway 
Research indicates that participation in graded work increases the probability to be in employment 
two years later by 16 percentage points. Furthermore, a study suggests that graded work mitigates the 
negative effect of sickness absence on firm profits by 70%. In Norway, employees on sick leave are 
required to be in work-related activity within eight weeks of sickness, unless certifying doctors can make 
a compelling case for a full sick leave. However, the activity requirement is not always rigorously 
enforced. A programme implemented in the Norwegian region of Hedmark in 2013 aimed to enforce 
the activity requirement more strictly. This was found to reduce working hours lost due to sickness 
absence by 12% in Hedmark, both because more persons with remaining work capacity started working 
part-time and because the average duration back to full-time work was reduced. The study also 
estimates that the programme reduced social security spending by USD 310 per employee per year in 
Hedmark, not taking into consideration any savings because of lower permanent disability benefit 
uptake later on. 
Occupational health programmes and workplace redesign can play a key role in mitigating 
the effects of demanding and hazardous jobs 
A significant challenge regarding workers’ health across OECD countries involves assisting older 
employees in moving out of demanding or hazardous jobs, which directly impacts their health, well-being, 
and career opportunities. Low-skilled workers in particular, are more likely to require additional support to 
transition to better opportunities later in their careers. 
In many OECD countries, special retirement provisions exist for these workers, allowing them to retire 
early without penalties (OECD, 2023[50]). However, a shift toward proactive strategies to enhance working 
conditions and support transitions to less demanding occupations could help extend careers and improve 
older workers’ quality of life. These strategies might include training and career counselling programmes,

OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
professional redeployment initiatives and strengthening occupational health policies to address sickness 
and disability at their source (OECD, 2023[50]). 
Job and workplace redesign can help organisations retain workers through modifying the tasks, 
responsibilities, or work environment of a role to align better with the abilities and needs of employees 
(Box 3.6). This is especially beneficial for older employees facing physical challenges or shifting priorities, 
as it allows them to contribute meaningfully while ensuring their well-being. The Work and Well-Being 
Initiative, a joint research effort by Harvard and MIT, has developed a toolkit to reshape workplace 
conditions that contribute to stress-related health problems. The toolkit is based on three core principles: 
increasing worker schedule control and voice, moderating job demands, and enhancing social relations at 
work through employer support and training (Lovejoy et al., 2021[129]; The Work and Well-Being Initiative, 
2021[130]). Lack of control over work schedules can lead to stress, but greater autonomy has been linked 
to higher productivity and lower turnover (Kelly and Moen, 2020[131]; Moen, Kelly and Hill, 2011[132]). 
Addressing physical strain through regular workplace risk assessments, which account for both physical 
and psychosocial hazards, is another key component of stress reduction (Bevan and Cooper, 2022[133]). 
Lastly, workplace social relationships play a crucial role in employee well-being. Initiatives such as the 
Availability, Responsiveness, and Continuity (ARC) programme, tested among social services workers in 
child welfare and mental health programmes in the United States improved workplace climate, reduced 
burnout, and enhanced job satisfaction (Glisson, Dukes and Green, 2006[134]; Glisson et al., 2012[135]). 
These strategies collectively highlight the importance of redesigning work environments to prevent poor 
health outcomes and enhance overall well-being. 
Box 3.6. Preventing workplace injury and job redesign 
Preventing occupation health-related injury in France 
France offers several policies geared towards preventing and addressing the mental and physical 
effects of work. Taken together, the policies raise awareness of workplace ageing and enable workers 
to transition to safer roles. 
• 
The Professional Prevention Account (C2P) (Compte professionnel de prévention) provides 
workers in hazardous conditions with autonomy to make changes in their career. Workers 
exposed to occupational risk factors (e.g. night work, successive alternating shifts, exposure to 
loud sounds, etc.) acquire points that can be exchanged for work in a less exposed position, 
finance a professional retraining project, change to a part-time work schedule, or access early 
retirement.1 
• 
Created in 2023, France’s Investment Fund for the Prevention of Occupational Wear and Tear 
(FIPU) (Fonds d’investissement dans la prévention de l’usure professionnelle) aims to protect 
workers’ health by reducing exposure to three key ergonomic risk factors: manual handling of 
loads, awkward postures, and mechanical vibrations – which together account for over 87% of 
recognised occupational illnesses. The fund supports action at three levels. For employees, it 
facilitates access to retraining through the professional transition project, covering most training 
costs. For companies, it offers subsidies for ergonomic equipment, training, diagnostics, and 
workstation adaptations. At the sectoral level, professional branches help define at-risk 
occupations, guiding the fund’s targeted allocations. Industry-specific prevention bodies may 
also receive dedicated funding to expand awareness and preventive efforts. 
• 
The French policy on Strengthening Occupational Health Prevention (Renforçant la prévention 
en santé au travail) allows all workers around age 45 to meet with an occupational physician to 
ensure that the worker is healthy enough for their role and knows how to prevent occupational 
wear and tear. The occupational physician can propose job adjustments, as well as initiatives

to promote lifelong learning, such as supervised trials and re-skilling within their firm. In 2021, 
the law was strengthened to enable all workers returning to work after a long-term leave to test 
a new job within their company or another company. 
Job redesign in Singapore 
The Job Redesign Centre of Excellence (JRCoE) was established by Workforce Singapore in 
collaboration with the Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) to serve as a one-stop centre 
for enterprises aiming to transform their business and workforce through job redesign (Workforce 
Singapore, 2024[136]). The JRCoE focuses on three strategic pillars: Thought Leadership, Capability 
Development, and Advocacy and Action. Enterprises which are keen to embark on job redesign can 
access funding support of up to SGD 30 000. The JRCoE supports enterprises by providing industry-
relevant expertise and resources, such as sector-specific playbooks and capability development 
workshops, to facilitate the adoption of job redesign practices. Additionally, it promotes best practices 
across its network of HR professionals to accelerate enterprise transformation. An expert panel, 
comprising leaders from the Ministry of Manpower, National Trades Union Congress, Singapore 
National Employers Federation, academia, and industry professionals, provides strategic oversight to 
advance job redesign adoption in Singapore. Key initiatives of the JRCoE include advocacy campaigns 
to encourage greater adoption of job redesign, development of sectoral playbooks (starting with HR and 
retail sectors) to guide enterprises through a structured approach, and workshops to equip HR teams 
with the necessary knowledge and skills. 
1. Since the introduction of the Professional Prevention Account (C2P), the number of retiring insured persons who have acquired at least 
one point during their career has been steadily increasing: it increased from 6 610 in 2016 to 21 380 in 2021 (Beaufort, 2023[147]). However, 
only 1 010 insured persons who left in 2021 benefited from at least one increase in the length of insurance (MDAP) generating an effective 
additional pension right. No information is currently available on how the points have been used for part-time work or training purposes. 
Job rotation and redeployment programmes help workers, particularly those with health-related issues or 
those in arduous occupations, to identify and transition into roles that better align with their skills and 
aspirations. Redeployment schemes help prevent occupational health issues by reallocating workers within 
a firm, demonstrating employer support and fostering intergenerational exchange. However, employers 
sometimes misuse these schemes to address skills shortages rather than prioritising workers’ needs (Lain, 
Vickerstaff and van der Horst, 2022[137]). To be effective, redeployment should enhance employability, 
flexibility, and health, preventing workers from feeling downgraded (Naegele and Walker, 2006[138]). These 
schemes work best when paired with retraining and upskilling. While employer-led programmes are ideal, 
government initiatives like Luxembourg’s Professional Redeployment Programme (Reclassement 
Professionnel) supports eligible workers to reintegrate into a role that is adapted to their health and 
flexibility needs within the same company, or potentially another company (OECD, 2024[69]). 
3.5. Concluding remarks 
Supporting longer working lives requires a comprehensive approach that reflects the profound 
demographic, economic and technological transformations reshaping labour markets. The last couple of 
decades have seen a remarkable increase in the employment of older workers and as life expectancy 
increases and people remain healthy in later life, the potential to extend working lives continues to grow. 
Pension reforms such as raising retirement ages or restricting early exit pathways have contributed 
significantly to raising the average age of labour market exit, yet these efforts must be embedded within a 
broader policy framework that actively enables older people to remain in, or re-enter, the workforce. This 
includes supporting employers to implement age-inclusive practices – from fair recruitment and retention

strategies to inclusive talent management – and fostering workplace environments that promote 
productivity across all age groups. 
Crucially, promoting longer working lives must go hand-in-hand with efforts to tackle persistent inequalities. 
Significant disparities in employment outcomes by gender, education level, and health status continue to 
undermine inclusive labour market participation. Addressing these gaps requires tailored interventions that 
ensure older workers – especially those with lower educational attainment, chronic health conditions, or 
caregiving responsibilities – have real opportunities to stay active in the labour market. 
Moreover, adapting to a fast-evolving world of work is essential. Advances in digital technology and AI are 
reshaping skill demands, often disadvantaging older workers in manual or routine jobs. Simultaneously, 
the green transition is generating new employment opportunities that demand updated or entirely new 
skills. Lifelong learning must become a central pillar of employment policy, with access to upskilling and 
reskilling opportunities available throughout the life course. Special attention should also be given to 
employee-oriented flexible work options and healthy working conditions, which are vital for sustaining 
employability over time. 
A life-course perspective is essential. Evidence shows that steady employment during one’s 50s is a strong 
predictor of continued labour market participation into one’s 60s. Early and sustained investment in health, 
skills, and career development – including through occupational health programmes, flexible retirement 
schemes, and inclusive parental leave policies – can help prevent premature labour market exits and 
improve long-term employment prospects. 
In sum, preparing for an ageing workforce is not just about delaying retirement – it is about reimagining 
the entire working life. Only by integrating structural reforms with targeted support, inclusive employment 
practices, and future-oriented workforce policies can OECD countries ensure that longer working lives are 
not only achievable but also fair, productive, and fulfilling for all.

Notes
 
1 In contrast lower-educated older workers, particularly in routine or manual occupations, face a higher risk 
of displacement due to automation, as they have fewer opportunities to transition into AI-enhanced roles 
(Lane, 2024[2]). Moreover, older workers generally have lower access to AI-related upskilling opportunities, 
which further exacerbates skill mismatches and reduces their employment prospects in an AI-driven 
workforce. 
2 Across all age groups the variation in employment rates has fallen (for example at age 45-54 the standard 
deviation in employment rates fell from 8.2% in 2000 to 6%, and from 13.7% to 8.1% at age 55-59). 
3 The standard deviation in employment rates at age 60-64 in 2023 was 13.5%, more than double that at 
age 45-54. 
4 The absolute gap in educational attainment between 25-34 year-olds and 55-64 year-olds with below 
upper secondary narrowed from 26.7 percentage points in 2000 to 12.6 percentage points in 2023 (OECD, 
2024[8]). The gap fell from 16.9 percentage points in 2000 to 4.4 percentage points in 2023 for those with 
upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education. For those with tertiary education the gap 
increased from 10.8 percentage points to 17.1 percentage points. 
5 Minimum years of pension contributions can also mechanically explain why more educated people work 
until later in their life. 
6 Low intermittent refers to being in employment between 1-49% of the time during your 50s. High 
intermittent refers to being employed between 50-99% of the time during your 50s. 
7 For Korea the overall decline in hours for workers aged 15-64 between 2001-03 and 2021-23 was 18.3% 
for women and 17.7% for men. 
8 Where retirement ages differ across schemes the maximum across schemes thus defines the NRA of 
the country. 
9 This includes Korea, Colombia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, 
France, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Spain, Sweden, Norway and Portugal (OECD, 
forthcoming[51]). 
10 Results from recent OECD cross-country analysis reveal that raising the normal retirement age 
increases older-age employment, but the effects differ substantially across countries depending on 
institutional and demographic factors. Incorporating features such as the demographic composition, the 
distinction between normal and minimum retirement ages, the role of private pensions, and the existence 
of early exit pathways allows for a more accurate reflection of country-specific dynamics (Morgavi, 
2024[146]). Morgavi (2024[146]) finds larger and more heterogeneous employment effects than in earlier 
pooled estimates, with cross-country model predictions closer to those of single-country microdata studies 
discussed above. 
11 In an analysis of the large concentration of retirement behaviour around statutory retirement ages in 
Germany, Seibold (2021[64]) shows that policies relying solely on financial incentives to encourage later 
retirement are less effective and more costly. Similarly in Finland, Gruber et al. (2022[65]) found that 
relabelling of retirement ages in 2005 led to a huge increase in retirements, with cohorts subject to the

OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
 
change being 680% more likely to retire compared to those not affected. This followed a reform that raised 
the ERA from 60 to 62, and relabelled the NRA from 65 to 63, making 63 the new focal point for retirement. 
This effect was much larger than the impact of financial incentives such as changes in pension wealth or 
accrual rates, indicating that the labelling of retirement ages strongly influences retirement decisions. 
12 The State Pension Age change for women increased the employment rate of 60-63 year-old women by 
11 percentage points over the period between 2010 and 2017. Banks et al., (2025[68]) exploit the fact that 
due to the policy changes, women born only months apart experienced differing pension ages. 
13 Rabaté et al. (2024[52]) use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effects of increasing 
the Statutory Retirement Age in the Netherlands. They identify the mechanical and behavioural effects by 
comparing the observed treatment effects of the SRA reform to predictions from a simple mechanical 
model. The results show that the mechanical model predicts the treatment effects very well, confirming 
that almost all the increased participation in DI and UI is due to mechanical effects rather than behavioural 
changes. 
14 Rabaté et al. (2024[52]) also consider the fiscal implications of the reform and find government savings 
on first-pillar pensions: EUR 874 per person per month, increased tax revenue from continued employment 
of EUR 307 per person per month, and additional costs from increased DI and UI claims of EUR 432 per 
person per month. This results in a net fiscal gain for the Government of EUR 550 per person per month, 
translating to EUR 66 million per month for a full cohort. 
15 These results are consistent with other studies of pension reforms. Estimates from the United Kingdom 
showed that raising the ERA delayed retirement but did not lead to an unexpected surge in DI or UI claims 
(Cribb, Emmerson and Tetlow, 2016[142]). In evaluating pension reforms in 2010 in France which raised the 
statutory retirement age (SEA) from 60 to 62, Rabaté and Rochut (2020[143]) show that while the reform 
significantly increased employment rates among older workers, it also led to a rise in unemployment and 
disability claims. Specifically, while 40% of those who could no longer retire at 60 remained in employment 
for an additional year, the majority of the remainder shifted to unemployment, sickness or disability benefits. 
This shows that the reform was highly effective for those still employed at age 60 but had limited impact 
on those already out of the labour force. Further, Rabaté and Rochut (2020[143]) show that the employment 
effects were concentrated among individuals who were still employed when reaching the SEA, and that 
the substitution effects were driven by individuals already out of the labour force, rather than by direct 
substitution from work to alternative schemes. About 85% of those who would have retired instead 
continued working for an additional year, while among individuals unemployed at 59, 87% remained in 
unemployment rather than transitioning to retirement. Similarly, among those who were receiving disability 
insurance, 96% continued to receive disability insurance. They also find evidence of substitution from non-
work status to employment, with 29% of those on sickness leave returning to work instead of retiring. 
16 The effect of increasing flexibility on when people can enter retirement on total labour supply is 
theoretically ambiguous, being the result of both changes in the extensive margin (labour force 
participation) and the intensive margin (average hours worked). On one hand it can encourage people to 
stay in the workforce who might otherwise leave early through retirement or unemployment. On the other 
hand, it can also lead to a decline in labour supply if full-time employees, who would have continued 
working until the standard retirement age, choose partial retirement instead, thereby cutting their working 
hours. The evidence on which effect prevails is mixed, and estimating the causal effect of flexible or partial 
retirement reforms on longer working lives is challenging. First, it is difficult to establish a counterfactual – 
what would have happened to workers had they not participated in a partial retirement scheme. Many 
studies rely on self-reported intentions or retrospective surveys, which may not accurately reflect actual

behaviour. Second, selection bias is a concern, as workers who opt for partial retirement may differ 
systematically from those who do not, in terms of health status, job characteristics, or financial stability. 
This makes it challenging to isolate a scheme’s effect from other confounding factors. Third, differences in 
the design of partial retirement schemes across countries and time periods make cross-country 
comparisons difficult, as effects can vary significantly depending on the presence of early exit incentives 
and labour market conditions. 
17 A study of nine OECD countries found that phased retirement results in a slight increase in labour force 
participation and a decline in the number of hours worked, leading to no significant overall boost in labour 
supply (Börsch-Supan et al., 2018[144]). However, this study relies on aggregate country-level data rather 
than individual-level data, which limits its ability to account for heterogeneity in responses to flexible 
retirement reforms. For instance, the effects may vary by income level, education, occupation, or health 
status, but these distinctions cannot be fully explored in the analysis. 
18 Haan and Tolan (2019[74]) found that when the entry age into partial retirement is set equal to the ERA 
(age 63) the average retirement age increases by about 4.4 months, and the average employment exit 
age increases by about 6.5 months compared to a scenario without partial retirement. 
19 For example in Greece, up until 2024 if a pensioner wanted to work, 30% of the pension was withheld. 
Since 2024 pensioners who want to work do not see any reduction in their pension and they pay a 10% 
levy on any income earned. 
20 A blocked time model is essentially subsidised early retirement. In Austria there are two types of 
subsidised part-time work for older employees: the continuous model and the block model (OECD, 
2025[78]). The continuous model allows for part-time work over a period of up to five years. In contrast, the 
block model consists of a phase of full-time work for up to 2.5 years, followed by a phase of complete leave 
from work for the same duration. Public subsidies for these arrangements – provided by the Public 
Employment Service to employers – cover at least 90% of the costs for the continuous model and 35% (as 
of 2025) for the block model. 
21 For workers aged 50-54 there has been a modest increase from 10.9% to 11.1% (between average of 
1997-99 and average of 2020-22). Among those aged 55-59 there has been a decline from 10.5% to 9.7%, 
and a more substantial decline from 11.4% to 9.7% for those aged 60-64. 
22 Hiring discrimination is particularly difficult to demonstrate and challenge if the burden is left to the victim. 
23 Hellerstein and Neumark (1995[95]) finds that plants with a higher proportion of older workers tend to 
achieve greater output or productivity in Israel. Similarly in Portugal, Cardoso, Guimarães and Varejão 
(2011[96]) finds that older workers’ contribution to firm productivity exceeds their wage costs. In contrast, 
two studies conducted in the United States report the opposite effect, showing lower output or productivity 
in plants where a significant share of workers are aged 55 and above (Hellerstein and Neumark, 1995[95]; 
Haltiwanger, Lane and Spletzer, 2007[98]). Meanwhile, research from Austria, Finland, and Germany 
indicates no discernible relationship between workforce age and productivity (Mahlberg et al., 2013[99]; 
Daveri and Maliranta, 2007[100]; Göbel and Zwick, 2012[101]). 
24 This is consistent with other surveys that have found employers generally view older workers as equally 
or more productive than younger ones (Munnell and Wettstein, 2020[145]). Whether the findings reflect 
genuine responses or are influenced by a desire to appear politically correct is debateable. However, 
Munnell and Wettstein (2020[145]) also find responses to questions regarding productivity, costs, and 
attractiveness are consistent, lending credibility to the results. Over half of employers see no significant

productivity differences between older and younger workers, while those with a preference overwhelmingly 
favour older workers, particularly in professional roles, where 45% view them as more productive 
compared to only 1% who see them as less productive (Munnell and Wettstein, 2020[145]). In contrast other 
surveys present a different picture. In a survey of 10 000 companies conducted by Bersin and Chamorro-
Premuzic (2019[139]), over two-thirds of respondents indicated that they viewed age as a disadvantage 
rather than a competitive advantage. 
25 However, flexible work arrangements may have downsides. Working from home, for instance, may 
reduce chances of promotion due to less on-the-job training and face time in the office (He, Neumark and 
Weng, 2021[140]). Additionally, flexible work schedules may sometimes entail requirements to work longer 
or at irregular hours. Despite these potential drawbacks, a field experiment conducted on a Chinese job 
board found that application rates are higher for flexible jobs, conditional on the salary offered, providing 
evidence that workers value job flexibility (He, Neumark and Weng, 2021[140]). 
26 However, extended leave does not necessarily help women attain higher positions or narrow gaps in 
pay and working hours (Corekcioglu, Francesconi and Kunze, 2020[141]). Overly long maternity leave can 
negatively affect women’s health and hinder career progression (Canaan et al., 2022[121]; Healy and 
Heissel, 2020[114]). 
27 The reasons why people leave a job to go to another job are not available in this data. 
28 In Australia, the Disability Employment Services programme helps workers struggling to maintain their 
jobs due to injury, disability, or health conditions by connecting them with specialised providers. These 
providers offer individualised support, including workplace assessments, job modifications, and on-the-job 
assistance to help manage the impact of disabilities. Initial support lasts for 26 weeks, after which ongoing 
assistance may be recommended, with around 90% of employees continuing to benefit from long-term 
workplace support.

As the workforce in OECD countries gets older, many fear that productivity 
and economic growth may slow down. This concern is often related to the 
view that the relationship between individual productivity and age is hump-
shaped: increasing with experience at younger ages and then declining for 
older individuals as physical abilities and skills deteriorate. This chapter first 
examines three mechanisms that may affect how workers’ productivity 
changes with age: (i) the evolution of information-processing skills with age, 
(ii) the potential skills obsolescence of older workers because of labour 
market changes, and (iii) shifts in the occupational structure that may make 
it easier for workers to remain productive for longer. The chapter then 
investigates to what extent workers acquire knowledge through learning-by-
doing and training during their careers and provides examples of 
government policies that could help workers stay productive as they age.

In Brief 
Key findings 
As OECD countries are ageing, there is growing concern about the employability and well-being of older 
workers, who are expected to stay in the labour market for longer and account for an increasingly larger 
share of the workforce. Many also worry that an ageing workforce could lead to slower productivity 
growth and reduced economic dynamism. This is because the relationship between individual 
productivity and age is commonly viewed as hump-shaped: increasing with experience at younger ages 
and then declining for older individuals as physical abilities and skills deteriorate. Yet, there is 
considerable uncertainty regarding the age at which productivity starts declining. Moreover, the 
relationship between age and productivity is not fixed and may change as a result of greater investments 
in skills during the working lives, or through shifts in the occupational structure towards jobs that allow 
workers to stay productive for longer. This chapter investigates how the skills and jobs of older workers 
are related to their productivity and proposes policy solutions that could help individuals keep pace with 
changing labour market demands as they age. 
The key takeaways from the chapter are as follows: 
• 
While the differences in skills of older and younger individuals are partly due to 
generational differences, some patterns, such as the decline in information-processing 
skills within cohorts over the past decade and slower adjustment to labour market 
changes among older workers, suggest that age gaps in skills may persist in the future. 
o 
Older people (55-65 year-olds) have weaker information-processing skills than younger 
individuals. Literacy and adaptive problem-solving skills are 9% lower among 
55-59 year-olds and 12% lower among 60-65 year-olds compared to 25-29 year-olds. The 
gap in numeracy skills is slightly narrower, with 55-59 year-olds scoring 7% lower and 
60-65 year-olds scoring 10% lower than 25-29 year-olds. These age gaps are observed in 
all OECD countries, although the size of these gaps differs. While the differences in skills 
across the age groups are partly due to generational differences, such as educational 
attainment, over the past decade, information processing skills declined within birth cohorts, 
and this decline was faster for older cohorts. Both findings suggest that age-related decline 
in skills also plays a role. For example, over the last ten years, literacy skills declined by 5% 
among those who were 25-29 in 2012 and by 9% among those who were 50-54 in the same 
year. A similar trend was observed for numeracy skills. 
o 
Moreover, workforce adjustment to changing demand in the labour market, so far, has 
happened predominantly through younger workers. Downsizing occupations in the last 
decade have experienced larger increases in the average age of workers, which suggests 
that adjustment to changing economic structure occurs primarily through younger workers. 
Older workers were also less likely to use new productivity-enhancing technologies, as 
exemplified by lower use of ICT skills compared to younger individuals in the same 
occupation. For instance, the age gap in using specialised software ranged from 5% in 
Norway to 37% in Korea, and the use of programming language was more than 40% lower 
among older workers in some OECD countries. Slower adaptation to labour market trends 
and adoption of new productivity-enhancing technologies among older workers, especially 
as the share of older workers in the workforce grows, may hinder their employability and 
productivity, potentially weighing on the broader economy.

However, the shift in the occupational structure, away from jobs that require physical 
work and towards those that value experience, may make it easier for workers to remain 
productive for longer. While in some occupations, experience is valued and workers’ 
productivity can increase as they age, other occupations offer little wage growth opportunities. 
For example, 55-65 year-old managers earn over 50% more than 25-34 year-old managers, 
while the difference in wages is less than 5% between the two age groups in elementary 
occupations. Moreover, some occupations require more physical effort than others, making it 
more difficult for older workers to perform those jobs, leading to lower productivity or even labour 
market exit. The occupational composition differs significantly across OECD countries, implying 
that in some countries, there are more jobs that potentially allow workers to remain productive 
for longer. In general, however, the share of jobs that require daily physical work decreased in 
most OECD countries over the past decade, while the share of high-skilled occupations, which 
tend to offer higher returns to experience, increased. 
• 
Lifelong learning is crucial for workers to adapt to the changing labour market, but 
training participation and learning-by-doing decrease with age. In 2023, only a third of 
60-65 year-olds participated in training, compared to over half of 25-44 year-olds. Learning-by-
doing, another important but less often studied channel through which individuals develop new 
skills, also decreases with age, from 62% among 25-29 year-olds to 45% for 60-65 year-olds. 
One reason why training participation decreases with age is lower expected returns on such 
investment for individuals and employers due to shorter remaining working lives. However, 
recent evidence showing that adults underinvest in training even when returns significantly 
exceed the costs suggests that individuals may also underestimate the benefits of investment in 
training or face barriers to training participation. Moreover, if training postpones the decision to 
retire, the socially optimal level of training participation of older workers may be higher than the 
one chosen by the individual, given that keeping the individual in the workforce increases tax 
revenue and reduces pension benefit payments. Both social returns to training in excess of 
individual returns and underinvestment in training by individuals and firms would justify 
government intervention to lower the cost of training for older workers and address the barriers 
to training that they face. 
• 
The provision of career guidance and policies to promote participation in adult learning 
can help workers reflect on their professional journeys and address any skills gaps. 
Career guidance can assist individuals in assessing whether their current roles and skills align 
with their ambitions and labour market needs, and in identifying training needs. To increase the 
use of career advice services among adults, some OECD countries subsidise career advice 
sessions or even provide them free of charge. This is likely to be even more effective if done as 
a preventive measure and accompanied by targeted outreach campaigns. Governments can 
also offer financial incentives for mid-career (40-54 year-olds) and older people to participate in 
adult learning. One strategy is to offer financial support for participation in adult learning, 
regardless of age, for example, through individual learning accounts. Additional support 
specifically targeted at mid-career workers may also be beneficial, given that recent research 
suggests that training rates are particularly sub-optimal for middle-aged workers. Beyond 
financial incentives, it is important that training delivery and support services respond to the 
needs of mid-career and older workers, recognising the skills workers gained through informal 
on-the-job learning, offering shorter modular courses, and focusing the content on practical work 
problems rather than abstract technical concepts.

Introduction 
OECD countries are ageing, and there are concerns about the employability and well-being of older 
workers who are increasingly expected and encouraged to stay in the labour market for longer. Many also 
fear that as the workforce gets older, the economy’s capacity to innovate will diminish and productivity 
growth will slow down (IMF, 2016[1]; André, Gal and Schief, 2024[2]; ESM, 2024[3]). One source of this 
concern is the commonly held view that the relationship between productivity and age is hump-shaped: 
increasing with experience at younger ages and then declining for older individuals as physical abilities 
and skills deteriorate (André, Gal and Schief, 2024[2]). In line with this view, the “demographic dividend” 
experienced in the past that boosted productivity when the workforce’s average age increased from 
mid-30s to mid-40s may turn into a “demographic deficit” as populations continue to age (Henriksen and 
Cooley, 2018[4]) – see also Chapters 2 and 5. 
The first reason why workers’ productivity could decrease with age is the decline in certain cognitive skills 
and physical abilities (Kenny et al., 2008[5]; Desjardins and Warnke, 2012[6]). Prior research showed, for 
example, that older workers had lower numeracy, literacy and problem-solving1 skills than younger 
individuals (Paccagnella, 2016[7]). Rapid labour market changes, such as those due to technological 
transformation or greening, may further reduce the productivity of older workers if the skills they acquired 
early in life grow obsolete (OECD, 2019[8]; 2024[9]). On the other hand, technological change may also lead 
to shifts in the occupational structure, away from jobs that require physical work and towards those that 
value experience, making it easier for workers to remain productive for longer. Section 4.1 of this chapter 
examines these three mechanisms and their potential impact on the future productivity of older workers. 
While the relationship between productivity and age is influenced by broad economic forces – resulting in 
changing labour market demand – individual choices and government policies do matter in shaping this 
relationship. Preventing skills decline and ensuring that older workers are equipped with the skills to thrive 
in a fast-changing labour market can help them stay productive for longer. This requires that the traditional 
three-stage (school, work, retirement) life model gives way to a more flexible one where learning and work 
are intertwined and take place throughout life. Section 4.2 of this chapter explores how workers acquire 
knowledge both on the job and through training throughout their careers, and Section 4.3 provides 
examples of government policies that could help boost the skills and productivity of workers as they age. 
4.1. Generational divide or age-related decline: How will productivity evolve with 
age in the future? 
4.1.1. Information-processing skills decline as individuals grow older 
Human capital, reflected in the level of education and skills, is critical for labour market success. It is linked 
to both individual productivity and labour market outcomes, such as employment and wages, and to 
aggregate economic performance. Data from the first cycle of the Survey of Adult Skills conducted in 2012 
showed that older workers had lower numeracy, literacy and problem-solving skills than younger 
individuals (Paccagnella, 2016[7]). This section first investigates whether these patterns persist using new 
data from the second cycle of the Survey of Adult Skills collected in 2023. It then attempts to disentangle 
the generational differences in skills and the ageing effect to shed light on whether similar skills gaps 
should be expected in the future. 
The 2023 Survey of Adult Skills data confirm that older people (defined in this chapter as those aged 55-65) 
have weaker information-processing skills, such as literacy, numeracy and adaptive problem-solving,2 
compared to younger individuals.3 In 2023, literacy and adaptive problem-solving skills were 9% lower 
among 55-59 year-olds and 12% lower among 60-65 year-olds compared to 25-29 year-olds (Figure 4.1, 
Panels A and C). The gap in numeracy skills was slightly narrower, with 55-59 year-olds scoring 7% lower 
and 60-65 year-olds scoring 10% lower than 25-29 year-olds (Figure 4.1, Panel B).

The gaps in information-processing skills between older and younger workers were recorded in all 
participating OECD countries, but the level of skills and the size of the age gap differed. The largest gap 
was observed in Estonia (18%), where 25-44 year-olds had one of the highest literacy scores in the OECD, 
while older individuals lagged behind. In contrast, Sweden had the highest literacy score among older 
workers and a small age gap in literacy as a result (Figure 4.1, Panel D). Age gaps in numeracy and 
adaptive problem-solving across countries were similar to those observed for literacy skills. 
Lower information-processing skills of older workers should be a source of concern, as they may be a sign 
of lower productivity. Workers with higher information-processing skills are, on average, more likely to be 
employed and earn higher wages (Box 4.1) which are, in turn, usually closely related to individual 
productivity – see e.g. Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske (1999[11]) and Lazear et al. (2023[12]).4 This 
remains true even when comparing individuals with the same level of education, suggesting that literacy 
skills capture additional information about the individual’s characteristics, which are rewarded in the labour 
market and go beyond a simple reflection of their educational attainment. 
The currently observed differences in information-processing skills across the age groups are driven by a 
combination of cohort (generational) and ageing effects. The cohort (generational) effect refers to the 
impact of being born in a particular time period on the skills level of the generation due to variations in 
technology exposure, labour market conditions and government policies during the formative years. For 
example, younger workers may have higher information-processing skills because they completed more 
years of education or were exposed to more advanced information and communication technologies during 
their educational pathways. The ageing effect, on the other hand, describes the decline in certain cognitive 
abilities, such as memory and information-processing speed, as individuals grow older. If the cohort effect 
is the only driver of differences across the age groups described above, then workers who are young today 
should not be expected to have lower information-processing skills as they grow older.5 However, if the 
ageing effect also plays a role, then the skills of present-day young workers may decline as they age, with 
potentially negative implications for their productivity. 
Box 4.1. Skills are related to employment rates and wages 
Individuals with higher literacy skills have, on average, higher employment rates and wages and the 
relationship becomes stronger with age. While higher employment rates and wages among those with 
greater skills may be influenced by factors like education, regression analysis suggests that literacy 
skills capture additional information about the individuals that are rewarded in the labour market and go 
beyond a simple reflection of their educational attainment. 
Workers who have one standard deviation higher literacy skills earn, on average, 7% more at the age 
of 25-34 and 14% more at the age of 55-65, than other individuals with the same level of education, 
field of study and demographic characteristics. Workers with higher skills are also more likely to be 
employed than other individuals with the same educational attainment. The difference in the likelihood 
of being in employment (rather than unemployed or inactive) associated with an increase in literacy 
skills by one standard deviation is 4 percentage points for 25-34 year-olds and 8 percentage points for 
55-65 year-olds.1 
  
1. These results are from a regression controlling for the interaction of age dummies with years of education and gender and controlling for 
field of study, place of birth and country fixed effects. However, employment rates, wages and skills may be correlated with unobservable 
characteristics such as ability or motivation. Therefore, these results should not be interpreted as causal.

Comparing individuals with the same level of education and field of study reveals that the gap in 
information-processing skills between younger and older workers is smaller than when comparing the 
overall population. This suggests that the cohort (generational) effect partly explains the lower skill levels 
observed among older workers. Yet, differences in education and field of study alone do not fully account 
for the skill gap (Figure 4.1, Panels A-C) – indicating that other factors also contribute to older workers’ 
lower proficiency. One potential explanation is that information-processing skills capture some differences 
in initial education across the age groups that are not captured by years and field of education alone. For 
example, the quality of initial education of older people could have been lower, leading older people to 
have lower skills than younger people with the same number of years and field of education. Exposure to 
certain technologies might have also facilitated the skill acquisition of present-day younger workers 
compared to older workers with the same education. Another potential explanation is that lower skill levels 
among older people could be a sign that skills decrease with age, the ageing effect. 
While disentangling these two effects further by comparing age groups in the same year is difficult, the two 
cycles of the Survey of Adult Skills can be used to follow cohorts over time to track how the skills of people 
born in the same years have changed over time. For example, the skills of individuals aged 25-29 in 2012 
can be compared to those of 35-39 year-olds in 2023. This analysis reveals that skills decreased as cohorts 
aged, and the effect was stronger amongst older individuals. For example, over the last ten years, 
numeracy skills declined by 3% among those who were 25-29 in 2012 and by 6% among those who were 
50-54 in 2012. Literacy skills declined by 5% among those who were 25-29 in 2012, and by 9% among 
those who were 50-54 in 2012. The analysis follows individuals with the same level of education and place 
of birth, which means that the decline in skills is not due to changes in the educational composition or 
migration background of the cohort.6 
However, it is important to note that the changes in skills within younger and older cohorts over the last 
decade were not the same in all countries. For example, in Sweden, no statistically significant decrease in 
literacy skills was observed in the younger or older cohort (Figure 4.2). In Finland, the literacy skills of 
those who were 25-29 years old in 2012 increased in the last decade, while the skills of those who were 
50-54 years old in 2012 decreased. In France and Austria, literacy skills declined over the last decade 
among younger and older cohorts, but the decline was stronger for older individuals. 
While the above-described changes in skills proficiency will reflect a combination of cohort and time effects, 
the decline in literacy and numeracy skills was more prominent for older workers than for younger ones, 
suggesting that the decline in skills with age may be, at least partially, due to ageing. A study using scores 
of a sample of adults who participated in the Survey of Adult Skills in Germany in 2012 and were retested 
in 2015 suggests that, when following individuals over time, literacy skills (numeracy skills) peak at the age 
of 41 (46) but decline afterwards (Hanushek et al., 2025[13]).

The decrease in literacy and numeracy skills over time was more pronounced for those without tertiary 
education. The literacy and numeracy skills of those who were 50-54 years old in 2012 and had higher 
education decreased by 7% and 5%, respectively, over the last 10 years, while for the same age group 
without tertiary education, the decreases were 10% and 7%. These patterns are consistent with the 
cumulative (dis-) advantage hypothesis (Matthew effect), which, in the context of skills, predicts that initial 
skill differences become magnified over the life course. For example, those with higher educational 
attainment and skills obtain more complex jobs that foster further skill development (Lechner et al., 
2021[14]). Indeed, significant differences in how much skills decline over time were observed across 
occupations (Annex Figure 4.A.2). While the literacy skills of cleaners, machine operators and building 
workers declined by 9% or more over the last 10 years, in various professional and managerial 
occupations, the decline was 4% or less. This is in line with the findings using data from repeated surveys 
of the same individuals in Germany (Hanushek et al., 2025[13]) and consistent with higher skills dispersion 
in the oldest age groups (i.e. among those who were 45-49 and 50-54 in 2012), which means that not all 
older individuals experienced the same decline in skill levels. 
Further research using longitudinal data is needed to better understand the reasons why skills decline with 
age. One possibility is that adults and their employers increasingly underinvest in training as individuals 
age, resulting in lower skill levels among older individuals and potentially reducing their productivity. If that 
is the case, interventions to boost the skills of adults at an older age would be an appropriate policy 
response.7 
However, an alternative explanation is that individuals who achieve higher skill levels early in life enter 
better-paid occupations, which require stronger information-processing skills and provide adults with 
opportunities to utilise these skills as they age, preventing skill decline. Adults who follow lower-paid career 
paths may utilise their information-processing skills less at work, so they are more likely to decline with 
age. In that case, the decline in skills with age would not necessarily be a result of underinvestment in

skills, but rather a consequence of entering certain occupations that require fewer information-processing 
skills earlier in their careers and would be better addressed through early policy interventions, such as 
career guidance for youth. 
Finally, it is also possible that as workers age, the tasks they perform shift from those that require 
information-processing skills to those requiring other skills, such as decision-making and managing others. 
In that case, information-processing skills could decline without necessarily leading to lower productivity. 
While the Survey of Adult Skills only collects data on information-processing skills, the analysis of tasks, 
such as “managing” and “influencing”, shows that while the share of workers performing these tasks 
increased with age in younger age cohorts, potentially compensating for the decline in information-
processing skills, this effect was much weaker for older age cohorts (Box 4.2). 
Box 4.2. As workers get older, they tend to take on greater managerial and influencing 
responsibilities, especially in the early phases of their careers 
When following cohorts over the last decade, the share of workers managing others increased by 8 and 
3 percentage points among individuals who were 25-29 and 30-34 in 2012, respectively (Figure 4.3). 
These age groups also experienced the largest increase in the extent to which they influenced others 
at work, for example, by giving presentations, negotiating and teaching. In contrast, among older age 
groups, the share of workers managing others slightly decreased over the same time period, and the 
increase in influencing others was less marked than among younger age groups.

4.1.2. The adjustment to the changing demand in the labour market happens 
predominantly through younger workers 
Another mechanism that may lead to older workers lacking the skills needed in the labour market and their 
lower productivity, compared to younger individuals, are changes in the labour market resulting from 
megatrends such as digitalisation, automation and the green transition. This sub-section investigates how 
the adjustment to labour market trends and adoption of new productivity-enhancing technologies differ 
across age groups, highlighting the implications for economic dynamism and productivity as populations 
age. 
Economic changes mean that some jobs disappear while other jobs, requiring a different skillset, are 
created. For example, in the past, automation displaced bank tellers but created new roles in banking, 
such as IT specialists to maintain digital banking systems. Moreover, many of the jobs that remain change 
significantly in terms of tasks and skills they require. In the past, the job of auto mechanics primarily 
involved using hand tools to diagnose vehicles through physical inspections, while today, this is often done 
using computerised diagnostic tools, which require workers to have digital skills. 
While older workers are more likely to be in a job that matches their educational attainment than those who 
are new in the labour market, as sorting into well-matched jobs takes time (OECD, 2024[10]),8 they may be 
more likely to be mismatched in terms of occupations and skills currently needed in the labour market than 
younger people, who grew up with the new technologies, had a better chance of choosing educational 
pathways aligned with the current labour market demand and followed school curricula that already 
reflected the new skills needs. 
The first piece of evidence supporting this hypothesis is the increase in the average age of workers in 
occupations that declined in size over the last decade, which is in line with younger workers having 
incentives not to enter declining occupations, or to leave them, and older workers being discouraged from 
exiting them due to the costs associated with occupational mobility. For example, handicraft workers, 
occupations for which demand decreased by 20%, experienced an increase in the average age by 
2.4 years over the last decade (Figure 4.4). In contrast, in ICT professionals and business & administration 
professionals, occupations that grew the fastest over the last decade, the average age decreased by 0.2 
and increased by 0.4 years, respectively. 
These findings are consistent with prior research, which showed that in the United States, occupations that 
shrank became “older” – 1 percentage point contraction between 1980 and 2005 was associated with an 
increase in average age in the occupation by an additional 0.78 years relative to the mean (Autor and 
Dorn, 2009[15]).9 Similar patterns were found for routine and middle-skill jobs (Lewandowski et al., 2020[16]; 
Green, 2019[17]). The change in average age was shown to be driven by a falling employment share of 
young workers and rising employment shares of prime-age and older workers (Autor and Dorn, 2009[15]).

The second piece of evidence suggesting a more significant skills mismatch among older workers is the 
lower use of ICT skills by older workers compared to younger individuals in the same occupation. While it 
is a well-established fact that older workers have lower digital skills than younger individuals (Eurostat, 
2024[18]), this alone is not necessarily a sign of a mismatch. Instead, older workers could be employed in 
different occupations in which they are less likely to need digital skills compared to younger individuals. 
The analysis of Survey of Adult Skills data suggests, however, that, even within the same occupation, older 
workers are less likely to use advanced ICT skills (Figure 4.5). Significant age gaps exist in the share of 
workers creating electronic documents, using specialised software and using a programming language.10 
For example, the age gap in using specialised software ranged from 5% in Norway to 37% in Korea, and 
the use of programming language was more than 40% lower among older workers in some 
OECD countries. In contrast, older workers were similar to younger workers in terms of their use of basic 
ICT skills, such as using a computer at work and using the internet to communicate with others or to access 
information.

Older workers were also shown to be less likely than younger ones to take up new job opportunities, such 
as those created by the transition away from carbon-intensive production technologies (OECD, 2024[9]). In 
the United States, workers aged 55-64 and those aged 65 and above were, respectively, 38% and 60% 
less likely than individuals aged 25-34 to transition from “dirty” to “green” jobs. Moreover, among workers 
aged 55-64 who left “dirty” jobs, the probability of moving to another “dirty” job was 25% higher compared 
to workers aged 18-34 (Curtis, O’Kane and Park, 2023[19]). 
Lower incentives for older workers to move away from declining occupations and develop new skills may 
be the reasons why most of the observed adjustment to labour market trends happens among younger 
workers. Older workers tend to have more occupation-specific expertise and if their bundle of skills cannot 
be fully transferred to other occupations wage losses would have to be incurred (Kogan et al., 2022[20]; 
Hudomiet and Willis, 2022[21]). This effect, combined with shorter remaining working lives to reap 
the benefits of retraining (see Section 4.2), means that older workers may have lower incentives to exit the 
declining occupation. Older workers may also be more protected from displacement, as longer job tenure 
– often correlated with age – is a key factor in the strength of employment protection legislation (OECD, 
2019[22]; Saez, Schoefer and Seim, 2023[23]). Finally, older workers may be barred from some new 
occupations due to discrimination and age stereotypes – see Chapters 3 and 5.  
Slower adaptation to labour market trends and adoption of new productivity-enhancing technologies 
among older workers, especially as the share of older workers in the workforce grows, may hinder 
economic dynamism, potentially weighing on the broader economy.

4.1.3. The changing occupational composition of the economy may help workers stay 
productive for longer 
As discussed in the previous subsection, labour market changes may lead to a skills mismatch among 
older workers, but they also offer opportunities by shifting demand towards more age-friendly jobs. While 
in some occupations, the return on experience is higher, and workers’ productivity and wages increase as 
they age, other occupations offer fewer development opportunities. Moreover, jobs differ in the degree to 
which they require physical strength, which declines with age (Kenny et al., 2008[5]) and other features 
preferred by older workers, such as flexible working and autonomy (Maestas et al., 2023[24]) (see 
Chapter 3). This section investigates how the changes in the occupational composition may affect workers’ 
ability to remain productive for longer. 
Research in the United States that tracked individual wage trajectories over time found that workers who 
became employed in occupations with a higher starting wage also experienced higher average wage 
growth in the subsequent eight years. For example, the wages of software engineers, police officers, and 
accountants are, on average, 100% higher eight years after they start work in their occupation, while the 
wages of cosmetologists, maids, or childcare workers barely change at all (Abraham et al., 2024[25]). 
The difference in salaries between 55-65 and 24-34 year-olds varies considerably across occupations, 
suggesting that wage growth trajectories vary across occupations as well over a longer time horizon. 
55-65 year-old managers earn over 50% more than 25-34 year-old managers, controlling for gender and 
country fixed effects, while the difference in wages is only 4% between 25-34 and 55-65 year-olds in 
elementary occupations (Figure 4.6). This is consistent with the higher dispersion in hourly earnings among 
older workers compared to younger age groups observed in the Survey of Adult Skills data.11

Different wage trajectories may be related to the variation in returns to experience both within the job and 
due to differences in career opportunities. Returns to experience have been shown to be positive among 
skilled workers, insignificant among low-skilled workers (Dustmann and Meghir, 2005[26]), and higher for 
non-routine tasks than for routine ones (Gonzaga and Guanziroli, 2019[27]). 
Moreover, some occupations require more physical effort than others, making it more difficult for older 
workers to perform those jobs, leading to lower productivity or even labour market exit.12 For example, 
81% of building and related trades workers and 73% of cleaners and helpers work physically every day, 
while this is the case for only 6% of business and administration professionals and 3% of ICT professionals 
(Annex Figure 4.A.3). 
The occupational composition differs significantly across OECD countries and may mean that in some 
countries, more jobs allow workers to remain productive for longer. In Chile, for example, 46% of workers 
are employed in jobs that require working physically for a long time every day, one of the highest shares 
among the countries included in the survey (Figure 4.7). At the same time, only 33% of workers in Chile 
hold high-skilled occupations, where the increase in wages is the highest with age. In contrast, in the 
Flemish Region (Belgium), far fewer jobs require physical effort (32%) and almost 60% of workers are 
employed in high-skilled occupations where wages increase significantly with age.

productive for longer

In the future, changes to the occupational composition, away from jobs that require physical work and 
towards those that value experience, may make it easier for workers to remain productive for longer.13 
Over the last decade, the share of jobs that require working physically every day decreased in most 
OECD countries (Annex Figure 4.A.4), while the share of high-skilled occupations that tend to offer higher 
returns to experience increased.

The changes in the structure of economic activity within countries may not be exogenous and, instead, 
may be affected by demographic changes. For example, ageing countries may specialise in industries with 
high returns to experience and shift away from industries in which skills and abilities that depreciate with 
age, such as physical strength, are more important (Cai and Stoyanov, 2016[28]). On the other hand, ageing 
may also lead to changes in the structure of consumption, for example, increasing demand for long-term 
care (Causa et al., 2025[29]; Oliveira Martins et al., 2005[30]). Finally, robots and AI will also affect the tasks 
performed by humans, potentially leading to a decrease in demand for physical tasks (ITF, 2023[31]). 
4.2. Lifelong learning: The key to ageing well – but are workers using it? 
Compared to younger workers, older workers tend to be at a disadvantage in terms of the information-
processing skills they possess and the jobs they perform. Whether these patterns will be replicated in the 
future will depend on economic changes affecting occupational composition, but it will also depend on how 
well workers are equipped to adapt to the changing labour market and whether they are supported to 
develop their skills as they age. 
In this context, lifelong learning has a critical role to play. It can help workers prevent skills atrophy, adapt 
to the changing labour market, and move into higher-productivity and better-paying jobs. Recent evidence 
from Denmark demonstrates that the returns on investment in human capital can be high for adults, with 
earnings found to be 25% higher among those with a vocational qualification who returned to education to 
complete a bachelor’s degree (Humlum, Munch and Plato, 2023[32]).14 Randomised evaluations of sector-
focused training programmes also found substantial and persistent earnings gains following training, 
ranging from 12% to 34%, depending on the scheme (Katz et al., 2022[33]). This is consistent with positive 
returns to training found in the meta-analysis of active labour market policies (Card, Kluve and Weber, 
2018[34]). Work-related training was also found to be correlated with direct measures of productivity, with 
1 percentage point increase in training associated with an increase in value added per hour of 0.6% and 
0.3% in hourly wages (Dearden, Reed and van Reenen, 2006[35]). 
This section investigates how training participation and on-the-job learning evolve as workers age, 
highlighting differences across countries. 
4.2.1. Training participation and learning-by-doing decrease with age 
Participation in formal and non-formal adult learning decreases with age. In 2023, only a third of 
60-65 year-olds participated in adult learning in the 12 months preceding the survey, compared to over 
half of the 25-44 year-olds (Figure 4.8, Panel A). The most notable drop in adult learning participation 
occurs between the ages of 55-59 and 60-65. Non-formal training was significantly more common than 
formal learning (i.e. training that led to a qualification) across the age groups, but this was particularly the 
case among older individuals, with only 1% of 60-65 year-olds participating in formal learning. 
Learning-by-doing, another important but less often studied channel through which individuals develop new 
skills, also decreases with age. Among 25-29 year-olds, 62% report learning by doing at least every week 
compared to 45% among 60-65 year-olds (Figure 4.8, Panel B). Learning by doing is only observed for those 
who are employed, and employed individuals tend to have higher rates of training, which likely explains why 
learning-by-doing decreases less with age than training participation in the wider population.15 
Workers aged 55-65 are 7 percentage points less likely to participate in training and 14 percentage points less 
likely to be learning-by-doing compared to 25-34 year-olds with the same level of education and occupation. 
This suggests that the lower degree of learning is not just due to generational differences, such as different 
educational attainment leading to differences in occupational composition, but instead, it is related to age.

Participation in non-formal training and learning-by-doing differ significantly across socio-economic groups, 
both in terms of levels and trends as workers age. For example, participation in non-formal learning for those 
with tertiary education fluctuates around 60% between the ages of 25 and 54 and only starts decreasing 
afterwards, i.e. 10 years later than in the general population (Annex Figure 4.A.5). Among tertiary educated 
60-65 year-olds, non-formal training participation remains at a relatively high level of 49%. In contrast, the 
training participation rate of those without upper secondary education is lower and starts decreasing earlier 
in life, dropping to 9% among 60-65 year-olds. Learning-by-doing is also significantly higher among the 
tertiary educated, but it decreases gradually throughout life, regardless of the level of education.

The lower participation in non-formal learning of older individuals may stem from either a lower willingness 
to train (defined as the likelihood that workers identified learning opportunities that they wanted to take up) 
or greater barriers to accessing training, such as time constraints or costs of training courses. Evidence 
indicates that a lower willingness to train is likely a key factor. The share of the population that wanted to 
participate in training (regardless of whether they did)16 decreases with age, from around 60% among 
25-44 year-olds to 37% among 60-65 year-olds. A similar pattern is observed in the share of the population 
that participated in training less than they wanted to, which also decreases with age, from 28% among 
25-34 year-olds to 17% among 55-65 year-olds (see Box 4.3 for reasons why people participate in training 
less than they want to). 
Box 4.3. Barriers to training participation differ across age groups 
Time constraints are less of a barrier to training participation for older people than for other age groups. 
Among 55-65 year-olds, 7% reported participating in training less than they wanted to due to time 
constraints – 5% due to work-related reasons and 2% due to family reasons (Figure 4.9). In contrast, 
15% of 35-44 year-olds indicated time constraints as a barrier to training participation, with 8% pointing 
to work-related time constraints and 7% to family responsibilities. 
“Other” barriers to training participation, such as an unexpected event (e.g. health problems) or other 
reasons that the survey is not capturing, play a more important role among older people. A similar share 
of the 55-65 year-old population participated in training less than they wanted to due to “other” reasons, 
as in other age groups, while the overall share of the 55-65 population that participated in training less 
than they wanted was lower (Figure 4.9). This means that “other” reasons were a proportionally bigger 
barrier to training participation for older people compared to younger individuals.

Moreover, employers who are a key source of funding for training are less likely to invest in the training of 
older workers. Over half of the non-formal training in which individuals participated in the year preceding the 
survey was at least partially funded by employers, making firms the leading source of financing for workforce 
development. The share of the population that received non-formal training funded by employers in the year 
preceding the survey decreases from about 30% among 30-44 year-olds to 22% among 55-59 year-olds and 
14% among 60-65 year-olds. While this is partly due to lower employment rates at older ages, the share of 
employed individuals who participated in non-formal training funded by employers also decreases with age, 
from about 35% among 30-44 year-olds to 29% and 25% among the 55-59 and 60-65 year-olds, respectively. 
4.2.2. Large differences in training participation of older workers are observed across 
countries in the OECD 
While participation in non-formal learning of older individuals is lower than among the prime-age population 
(25-54 year-olds) in all OECD countries, both the level of participation among older people and the age 
gap differ significantly. The highest level of non-formal training participation among 55-65 year-olds is 
observed in Norway, Finland and Denmark (around 50%) (Figure 4.10). In contrast, the lowest non-formal 
training participation in this age group was recorded in Poland, Korea and the Slovak Republic (less than 
20%). Non-formal training participation of older people is highly correlated with the training participation of 
prime-age individuals, but the age gap ranges from 4 to 26 percentage points. For example, Canada has 
the fourth-highest non-formal training participation of prime-age people but a significant age gap 
(26 percentage points), ranking only twelfth for non-formal training participation of older people.

Learning-by-doing is also less common among older workers than it is among prime-age workers in all 
OECD countries, but the gap is narrower than for training. Learning-by-doing at least every week was most 
common among older workers in Portugal, Ireland and Spain (above 55%), and it was the lowest in Poland, 
Lithuania, Korea and Hungary (25% or less) (Annex Figure 4.A.7). While the intensity of learning-by-doing 
among older workers is correlated with the level of learning among prime-age workers, here, too, the 
overall level is not all that matters. For example, Italy and the Slovak Republic have a similar share of 
prime-age workers learning by doing, but while in the Slovak Republic the age gap was narrow, in Italy, a 
large age gap was observed, meaning that older workers were significantly less likely to learn on the job 
in Italy than in the Slovak Republic. 
4.2.3. Older workers train less due to lower expected returns, but they may also be 
underestimating the benefits of training 
One reason why older people are less likely to engage in training, and employers are less likely to fund 
their training, are lower expected returns on such investments due to shorter remaining working lives. 
Economic theory suggests that individuals make investment decisions by weighing expected returns 
against associated costs. Thus, a person is likely to pursue training only if its discounted returns outweigh 
both the financial and psychological costs involved. Since older workers generally have fewer years left in 
the workforce compared to their younger counterparts, the return on investment in training is lower for 
them. Consequently, lower participation in training among older workers is expected (OECD, 2019[8]; 
Picchio, 2021[36]). Similar arguments may apply to the decision to change jobs, which requires effort to 
learn new skills on the job to adapt to the new work environment (see Box 4.4) and to employers’ decision 
to invest in the training of older workers. 
Box 4.4. Lower job mobility of older workers might be contributing to lower learning-by-doing 
Workers who stay in the same job for longer are more likely to develop job-specific skills and may 
eventually feel less need to learn new skills to meet the demands of the job they hold. This is consistent 
with evidence showing that workers with longer tenure at the company are less likely to be learning-by-
doing, even after controlling for internal mobility within the company (Figure 4.11, Panel A). Given that 
job mobility declines with age – only 6% of 45-64 year-olds change jobs annually compared to 17% 
under the age of 30 (OECD, 2024[37]) – and tenure increases (Figure 4.11, Panel B), lower mobility 
could be responsible for lower learning-by-doing among older workers.

Moreover, if acquiring new skills is more challenging for older workers than for younger ones, the increased 
difficulty raises the cost of learning, further lowering the expected returns on training. While such effects 
would be consistent with changes in fluid intelligence – the ability to solve problems in novel situations 
independently of acquired knowledge – which is found to decrease with age (Desjardins and Warnke, 
2012[6]), evidence to suggest that older participants perform worse than their younger counterparts on tests 
after completing training is limited to software training (Charness and Czaja, 2006[38]). Moreover, the 
effectiveness of training for older workers may also depend on training methods, which are often designed 
to meet the needs of younger workers (Picchio, 2021[36]). 
The age gap in non-formal training participation is larger in countries with lower effective labour market 
exit age,17 especially for women (Figure 4.12).18 This is consistent with individuals and firms making 
decisions about participation in training based on the return on investment. For example, in Korea, where 
the effective labour market exit age for women was the highest (67) in 2022, the gap in non-formal training 
participation of older and prime-age women was relatively small (11%). In contrast, in Poland, the 
Slovak Republic and Austria, where the effective labour market exit age of women was 61-62 in 2022, the 
participation in non-formal training of women aged 55-65 was less than half of the non-formal training 
participation rate of prime-age individuals. 
Extending working lives – for example, through pension reforms – could lead to higher training participation 
if workers and firms make training investment decisions based on expected returns. Indeed, evidence 
suggests that pension reforms19 in the Netherlands and Italy had a positive impact on the training 
participation of workers in their 50s (Montizaan, Cörvers and De Grip, 2010[39]; Brunello and Comi, 2015[40]). 
This is consistent with the findings of other studies, which show that a drop in mortality rates, which 
extended the potential period during which investment benefits can be reaped, increased investment in 
general human capital (Kalemli-Ozcan, Ryder and Weil, 2000[41]; Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney, 
2009[42]). If the expected rate of return fully explained the lower training participation of older workers, this 
outcome could be efficient from the perspective of the individual, the employer and the economy.

However, there is a risk that individuals and employers may underestimate the returns on investment in 
training older workers and, therefore, choose an inefficiently low level of training participation, for example, 
if they believe that the ability of older workers to learn new skills is lower than it actually is. When hiring, 
employers expect mid-career and older applicants (aged 45 and above) to be a worse fit in terms of skills 
than younger applicants and to be less willing to learn new skills and try new technologies 
(OECD/Generation: You Employed, Inc., 2023[43]). These negative attitudes towards older workers may be 
partly driven by stereotypes. Evidence from correspondence studies shows that 50-year-old workers with 
the same qualifications and experience were less likely to be called back for interviews than younger 
workers due to discrimination (Baert, 2017[44]; Neumark, Burn and Button, 2019[45]; Carlsson and Eriksson, 
2019[46]), and similar mechanisms may apply to firms’ decisions to provide training. Moreover, older 
workers themselves may have lower confidence in their own ability to learn new skills, as they are less 
used to learning (Posthuma and Campion, 2009[47]). Individuals may also choose a level of training 
participation that is below the socially optimal level if the returns on investment are primarily captured by 
employers (see also Section 4.3.2). 
Finally, if training postpones the decision to retire, the socially optimal level of training participation of older 
workers may be higher than the one chosen by the individual or their employer, given that keeping older 
individuals in the workforce increases output and tax revenues and reduces pension benefit payments – 
see also Chapter 2. Research is, however, inconclusive about the effect of training on the employment of 
older workers and retirement decisions, with the results ranging from positive (Herrbach et al., 2009[48]; 
Kristensen, 2012[49]; Piccio and van Ours, 2013[50]; Berg et al., 2015[51]) to no effect (Stenberg, de Luna 
and Westerlund, 2012[52]; Boockmann, Fries and Göbel, 2018[53]). 
Both social returns to training in excess of individual returns and the underestimation of the return on 
training investment by individuals and firms would justify government intervention to lower the cost of 
training for older workers.

4.3. Policy solutions: Support mid-career and older workers now to age better 
tomorrow 
To avoid mismatches at older ages, workers should regularly reassess their skills and career objectives 
and participate in training to bridge any skills gaps. Governments can aid these efforts by offering low-cost 
career guidance services and promoting lifelong learning opportunities that reflect the learning needs of 
workers at different ages. This section presents examples of government interventions that facilitate 
access to career guidance and adult learning opportunities for older people and discusses preventive 
measures targeting mid-career individuals that can help workers age better – see Chapter 3 for policies 
that support better use of skills within firms. 
4.3.1. Career guidance for adults 
Career guidance can support adults in reflecting on their professional journeys and identifying steps to 
achieve a satisfying career as they age. First, advisors can assist individuals in assessing whether their 
current roles and skills align with their ambitions and labour market demand, while also considering their 
ability to sustain their jobs over time. Based on such assessments, advisors can suggest pathways for 
career progression or occupational shifts and propose training courses that will help the individual achieve 
their new career objectives. While the literature on the impact of career guidance for employed individuals 
is limited, offering career guidance to job seekers at risk of long-term unemployment in France was shown 
to increase the probability of finding a job (J-PAL, 2015[54]) and in the United States, individualised career 
guidance offered to job seekers increased the probability of finding a job as well as the salary and fringe 
benefits of those jobs (Mathematica, 2019[55]) – see also Chapter 3. 
Yet, the use of career guidance remains low in many OECD countries, especially among mid-career and 
older individuals. In 2020/21, 38% of mid-career adults (40-54 year-olds) and 27% of older adults 
(55-64 year-olds) in countries that participated in the OECD’s Survey of Career Guidance for Adults had 
spoken to a career advisor in the preceding five years. That was significantly lower than the use of career 
guidance among younger people (25-39 year-olds), at 49% (OECD, 2021[56]; 2022[57]).20 
While internationally comparable data for a broader number of countries is limited, the Adult Education 
Survey shows that similar patterns are observed for how often workers looked for information on learning 
opportunities. Mid-career workers (45-54 year-olds) and older workers (55-64 year-olds) are less likely to 
look for information on learning opportunities than younger workers (25-34 year-olds) (Figure 4.13). The 
highest share of mid-career workers who looked for information was recorded in the Netherlands (40%) 
and the lowest in Türkiye and Bulgaria (6% and 5%, respectively).

StatLink 2 https://stat.link/2gj1ch 
To increase the use of career advice services among adults and prevent skills mismatches at older ages, 
some OECD countries offer free or subsidised career advice services. While such services are commonly 
provided to unemployed individuals, schemes available to all adults, regardless of their employment status, 
also exist. For example, in Switzerland, individuals aged 40 or older can take advantage of free 
professional assessments, provided they are not already eligible for similar services due to unemployment 
status or disability. In Flanders and Brussels, adults who have at least seven years of work experience are 
eligible for “career vouchers” to participate in subsidised career guidance sessions delivered by accredited 
providers (see Box 4.5). Skills Development Scotland centres offer free advice to people regardless of age 
(Skills Development Scotland, n.d.[58]). In France, funding available to adults under individual learning 
accounts can be used to cover the cost of career advice services. In a number of countries, such as Austria, 
Germany and Estonia, Public Employment Services provide career guidance to all adults regardless of 
their employment status (OECD, 2021[56]). Finally, in Singapore, an initiative called Volunteer Career 
Advisors matches individuals, especially mature workers, with experienced professionals in the selected 
industry who provide peer-level support and career guidance to help the individual advance their career or 
transition to other jobs (see Box 4.5).

Career Counselling for those aged 40 and over, Switzerland 
Under the Viamia scheme in Switzerland, individuals aged 40 and over are offered a free professional 
assessment, provided they are not already eligible for similar services due to unemployment or 
disability. The process begins with participants completing a self-assessment questionnaire that 
focuses on their skills and motivation, along with submitting their CV. This is followed by a one-on-one

interview with a counsellor to analyse their personal and professional situation in light of current labour 
market trends and demands. If one session is not sufficient, additional interviews are arranged. The 
process concludes with the participants, supported by the counsellor, defining concrete actions to 
maintain or improve their employability. 
Viamia is a joint initiative of the Swiss federal government and the cantons. It was launched in 2021 as 
a pilot in 11 cantons and expanded nationwide in 2022. Between 2021 and 2024, a lump sum of 
CHF 1 200 was allocated per participants, which was estimated to cover six hours of counselling. In the 
period 2022-23, 13 169 individuals benefited from the scheme, out of whom the vast majority were 
women (70%), employed individuals (82%) and 40-50 year-olds (71%). 
Participant feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with an average satisfaction rating of 5.5 out 
of 6, and 98% of participants indicating they would recommend the programme to others. 
Career vouchers in Flanders and Brussels, Belgium 
In Flanders and Brussels, workers can use career vouchers (loopbaancheques) to participate in 
subsidised career guidance sessions. Individuals can benefit from two vouchers every six years. The 
first voucher allows them to participate in 4 hours of guidance, and the second one in 3 hours of 
guidance provided at a recognised career centre. The co-payment from the individual to use the voucher 
is EUR 45, while the estimated cost of career guidance is EUR 182 per hour (i.e. EUR 1 274 for 
seven hours). To be eligible, individuals need to live in Flanders or Brussels, be employed and have at 
least seven years of work experience in paid employment or self-employment. Individuals can apply for 
the voucher online on the VDAB portal, where the list of career centres can also be found. 
Between 2013 (when the scheme was set-up) and 2021, 155 000 citizens, or 5.2% of the employed 
population, used the vouchers. In 2024, 41% of participants were 30-40 years old and 33% were 
40-50 years old, which was significantly above the share of the employed that the respective age groups 
constitute (25% each). Workers above the age of 50 were underrepresented (22% of participants and 
32% of the employed). Career guidance centres participating in the scheme are required to demonstrate 
that at least 30% of the individuals they served belonged to disadvantaged groups, which includes those 
above the age of 50. 
Volunteer Career Advisors initiative, Singapore 
Under the Volunteer Career Advisors initiative, Workforce Singapore is building a pool of advisors from 
professional communities. These advisors are then matched with individuals, especially mature 
workers, who are employed in the same sector or who are looking to join the sector and seek peer 
support and career guidance. The initiative has been launched for the Accountancy, Electronics & 
Semiconductors, Healthcare, Information & Communication Technology, Sustainability and Retail 
sectors, and will be progressively rolled out in more sectors. The initiative is part of a broader 
SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package (see more details in Box 4.6).

Making career advice available may not be sufficient, and additional outreach efforts may be needed to 
boost the use of career guidance services. In the OECD’s Survey of Career Guidance for Adults, the 
second most common reason for not using career advice services, indicated by about 20% of mid-career 
individuals who did not participate in career guidance, was the lack of knowledge that such services 
existed. Similarly, a survey in Australia found that 42% of 50-69 year-olds did not know where to access 
career advice (National Careers Institute, 2022[66]). Moreover, many individuals do not feel the need to use 
career advice services, which was the most common reason cited for non-participation in the OECD’s 
Survey of Career Guidance for Adults. Half of mid-career women and 60% of mid-career men did not use 
career advice services because they did not think they needed them (OECD, 2021[56]). While for many of 
those individuals, that may be a rational choice, for others, it may be a result of the underestimation of 
opportunities and benefits that career advancement or change can offer. 
The field of healthcare could serve as a model for proactive early engagement with individuals to help 
prevent adverse outcomes later in life. Many countries contact individuals who reach a certain age and 
invite them to participate in health screenings to identify health problems early, such as mammography for 
women who turn 45. Similar outreach and tests, in the form of career guidance sessions, could be 
conducted to test the “health” of one’s career and prevent, rather than cure, any skill gaps. Statistical 
profiling could be used to predict an individual’s likelihood of leaving the labour force early and reach out 
only to those at high risk to reduce the cost of the intervention. 
Employers can also play an important role in supporting employee career development through regular 
career conversations and/or mid-career reviews (OECD, 2024[67]). For example, in France, employers are 
required to regularly provide career guidance to their employees. In 2008, France adopted a law that puts 
an obligation on companies to prepare “older workers” plans either in-house or in collaboration with social 
partners, which was subsequently replaced in 2013 by a requirement to conduct an appraisal review with 
all employees, regardless of age, every other year. Schneider Electric is an example of a French 
multinational company that put in place a Senior Talent Program to support workers in the late stages of 
their careers (aged 51 and above), which includes workshops that prepare both experienced workers and 
their managers to engage in career conversations at least once a year (OECD, 2024[68]). However, this 
approach should not be thought of as a replacement for career advice provided by an independent career 
guidance organisation, given that it is likely to focus on an individual’s future career within the existing 
organisation without considering the opportunities in different sectors or areas of activity (Eurofound, 
2017[69]). 
4.3.2. Support to participate in training for mid-career and older individuals 
Training is another key lever for enhancing older workers’ skills and productivity, and policy makers play 
an important role in encouraging investment in training by both individuals and employers. 
In this context, a key question faced by policy makers is whether to support lifelong learning for all or to 
introduce additional measures specifically targeting mid-career and older workers. As discussed in the 
preceding section, the returns to training decrease with age due to a shorter remaining working life, which 
reduces the incentives for both employers and individuals to pay for training at older ages. If social returns 
to training are higher than private returns, for example, because training participation delays retirement, 
thus reducing the government’s pension spending, providing additional financial incentives to older 
individuals and their employers may be socially desirable. Similarly, additional support for mid-career and 
older workers may be appropriate if they are sufficiently distinct from younger individuals in terms of 
educational attainment or behavioural aspects such as risk aversion, making them more likely to choose 
an inefficiently low level of training than younger individuals. 
Evidence from Denmark suggests that current rates of training are sub-optimal for workers between the 
ages of 40 and 50 in particular, both from the government and individual perspectives. A study which 
analysed the returns to a reskilling subsidy after a workplace injury found that only 6% of middle-aged 

--- Page Break ---
   229 
 
OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
workers reskilled after injury, while the costs to the government (covering tuition and benefits during 
training) pay for themselves through higher taxes and lower future benefit payments for 36% of these 
workers. A similar take-up of reskilling was found to be optimal from individual and social perspectives. By 
contrast, the reskilling rates among the youngest and oldest workers (age 20-30 and 60-65, respectively) 
were found to be close to the social optimum (Humlum, Munch and Plato, 2023[32]). While it is uncertain 
whether these results generalise to other contexts and countries, they suggest that underinvestment in 
training may differ by age, potentially providing justification for additional support for specific age groups. 
Several OECD countries provide more substantial financial incentives for firms to invest in the skills of mid-
career and older workers, or prioritise older workers when distributing funding for training. For example, in 
Germany, firms can receive subsidies (Förderung Beschäftigtenqualifizierung nach §82 SGB III) that cover 
between 25% to 100% of expenses associated with staff training depending on the company size and the 
characteristics of workers, with training costs of workers over the age of 45 being fully covered for 
companies with less than 500 employees (Bundesagentur für Arbeit, 2025[70]). In Austria, employers can 
obtain funding for the training costs of certain groups of workers (Qualifizierungsförderung für 
Beschäftigte), one of them being individuals above the age of 50. The subsidy covers 50% of the training 
fees, up to the limit of EUR 10 000 per person (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Wirtschaft, 2024[71]). In 
Poland, employers can apply for funding to cover the training costs of their employees from the National 
Training Fund (Krajowy Fundusz Szkoleniowy), with 80% of costs covered for SMEs and 100% for 
microenterprises. While the overall funds available each year are capped, priority is given to the training 
for workers who are 45 years old or older (Wojewódzki Urząd Pracy w Krakowie, 2024[72]). 
In Singapore, additional funding for training is offered directly to mid-career individuals without the need 
for employer support, which boosts individual choice and responsibility with regard to training. Higher 
subsidies to participate in training, in some cases above 90%, are offered to individuals who are 40 or 
older. The remaining costs can be covered through SkillsFuture Credit, which operates like an individual 
learning account. In addition, Singapore is planning to introduce an income-replacing allowance for mid-
career individuals participating in selected full-time training programmes (see Box 4.6). In Ireland, 
subsidised upskilling and reskilling courses (Skills to Advance) target workers aged 50 or older, among 
other vulnerable groups (Solas, n.d.[73]). 
Box 4.6. Support to participate in adult learning for mid-career individuals in Singapore 
Singapore offers additional funding for training to mid-career and older individuals in addition to its 
already generous funding for adult learning. First, the Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy, available to 
Singaporean citizens aged 40 and above, covers at least 90% of fees for courses funded by the Ministry 
of Education and up to 90% of courses funded by SkillsFuture Singapore. These courses range from 
technical and vocational education programmes to postgraduate level. 
In addition, Singapore offers SkillsFuture Credit, which operates like an individual learning account. All 
citizens aged 25 and above receive SGD 500 (EUR 350), which can be used to participate in approved 
training. The funding can be used at a time convenient for the individual and does not expire. In 2024, 
those aged 40 and above received a top-up of SGD 4 000 (EUR 2 800) to upgrade their skills. While 
the selection of courses for individuals 40+ is more restrictive than for the general population, it still 
includes approximately 7 000 courses, which are listed on MySkillsFuture website. 
The support measures can be used jointly. For example, a course worth SGD 17 200, costs only 
SGD 1 720 after the Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy and the remaining costs can be covered through 
the SkillsFuture Credit, meaning that there are no out-of-pocket expenses for individuals aged 40+.

Finally, in early 2025, Singapore is planning to introduce a new SkillsFuture Mid-Career Training 
Allowance, which will offer income replacement to those participating in selected full-time, long-form 
programmes. The allowance will be 50% of the average income of the individual over the last 12-month 
period, capped at SGD 3 000 (EUR 2 100) a month. The individuals will be able to use the allowance 
for up to 24 months over their lifetime.

Broader financial support for adult learning, regardless of age, that enables individuals to access training 
opportunities at any stage of their career can also help workers age better. This can be implemented 
through individual learning accounts (ILA), which provide individuals with a budget to spend on training at 
any point in their lives.21 Examples of countries that either have an ILA scheme or are piloting one include 
France, Singapore, Lithuania and Czechia. Greece has established a legal framework for ILAs, offering 
more generous funding depending on characteristics, such as age, and is preparing to pilot the scheme. 
A similar scheme, but focused on loans, where individuals are offered subsidised loan entitlement that can 
be used for education and training throughout life, is being piloted in the United Kingdom (Lifelong Loan 
Entitlement). Instilling the lifelong learning mindset from an early age and providing individuals with 
opportunities to upgrade their skills throughout life will not only improve their labour market position but is 
also likely to encourage them to seek training at an older age.22 
Another important question is how the cost of training should be shared between the labour market 
participants. Employers are well-positioned to ensure workers are equipped for a changing labour market, 
given that research suggests that they often reap substantial returns from training. For example, in France 
and Sweden, firms were found to capture 70% and 65% of the returns to firm-sponsored training, 
respectively (Ballot, Fakhfakh and Taymaz, 2006[76]) and, in the United Kingdom, work-related training was 
associated with a higher increase in productivity than in wages (Dearden, Reed and van Reenen, 2006[35]). 
However, social returns to training in excess of private returns may justify the government also sharing the 
cost of the training investment. 
To ensure fair funding responsibilities, collective bargaining can be leveraged, as was done in Sweden to 
introduce financial support to participate in training based on Education Support for Transition 
(Omställningsstudiestöd) agreement. Collective bargaining can also help ensure that upskilling efforts 
translate into higher wages and opportunities for career progression, thereby increasing the incentives for 
individuals to participate in training. Where funding for training is offered via government schemes, cost-
sharing between the government and employers can be facilitated through the introduction of a firm levy 
scheme, used to partially finance a dedicated training fund. For example, in France, employers are obliged 
to contribute to professional training (Contribution à la Formation Professionnelle, CFP), which finances 
various skills development initiatives, including the ILA. 
Yet, financial support alone may not be enough to boost the training participation of older workers, 
especially those with lower qualifications and skills. In Lithuania, France, Czechia and the Netherlands, 
30-49 year-olds were the main beneficiaries of ILAs and were overrepresented among its users compared 
to the general population, while those above the age of 50 and below the age of 30 were underrepresented 
(OECD, 2025[77]). 
Outreach strategies involving social partners, Public Employment Services, and local community 
organisations, followed by career guidance, can help individuals of all ages identify skill gaps and motivate 
them to engage in training. For example, Unionlearn, part of the British trade union umbrella organisation, 
supports skills development through a network of Union Learning Representatives. These 

--- Page Break ---
   231 
 
OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
workplace-based union members assess employees’ learning needs and co-ordinate training activities in 
collaboration with employers (Unionlearn, 2024[78]). Public Employment Services and community-based 
organisations can further promote training participation, including among those outside the workforce. 
In addition, it is important that adult learning systems offer mechanisms for recognition of prior learning 
and provide flexible learning options that respond to the constraints that adults are facing, such as lack of 
time due to work and family responsibilities. Experienced workers often possess skills gained through 
informal on-the-job learning, which are difficult to showcase through formal qualifications. The availability 
of recognition of prior learning systems allows adults to formally validate the knowledge they have acquired 
in an informal setting, which can not only directly improve the job prospects of older workers by making 
their skills visible to employers, but also facilitate participation in adult learning (OECD, 2019[22]). This is 
because recognising existing competencies, combined with shorter, modular courses, helps increase the 
relevance of training schemes by allowing individuals to focus only on content that addresses their skill 
gaps, shortens training duration and lowers its cost. 
Finally, adapting the content of training to the needs of older workers may increase the effectiveness of 
training. Research suggests that the training currently on offer may be less effective for older workers 
because it does not relate to their everyday experiences (Schirmer et al., 2022[79]) or focuses on abstract 
technical content rather than practical work problems (Zwick, 2011[80]). Here, too, collective bargaining can 
be leveraged to identify and articulate workers’ training needs (OECD, 2019[81]). 
4.4. Concluding remarks 
As the workforce in OECD countries gets older, it is increasingly important to ensure that workers stay 
productive as they age. The economic changes which shift occupational composition away from jobs that 
require physical work and towards those that value experience may make it possible for workers to remain 
productive for longer. However, there is a risk that these benefits will be offset by a decline in skills with 
age. Today, older workers tend to be at a disadvantage in terms of the information-processing skills they 
possess. The decline in information-processing skills within cohorts over the past decade and slower 
adjustment to labour market changes among older workers suggest that, if no action is taken, these age 
gaps in skills may persist in the future, which may weaken older worker’s capacity to remain in employment 
as well as hinder economic dynamism and slow down productivity growth, potentially weighing on the 
broader economy. 
To address this risk, there is a need for an urgent shift from the traditional three-stage (school, work, 
retirement) life model to a more flexible one where learning and work take place throughout life. 
Governments can help make that a reality by facilitating access to career guidance and adult learning, 
particularly focusing on mid-career and older workers, for whom the underinvestment in skills is the 
greatest. The field of healthcare could serve as a model for proactive early engagement with individuals to 
help prevent adverse outcomes later in life. Outreach and tests, in the form of career guidance sessions, 
could be conducted to test the “health” of one’s career and prevent, rather than cure, any skill gaps. To 
keep this process cost-effective, these sessions could be limited to individuals who statistical profiling 
suggests are most at risk of early exit from the labour force, such as those with lower educational 
attainment. Individual learning accounts could also be leveraged to boost training participation. Their

also allow governments to flexibly offer additional top-ups to target groups, for example, mid-career and 
older workers, when such needs arise.

Notes
 
1 In the first cycle of OECD Survey of Adult Skills, problems solving in technology-rich environment was 
measured. This concept was defined as “the ability to use digital technology, communication tools and 
networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others and perform practical tasks” 
(OECD, 2013[84]). 
2 In the 2023 Survey of Adult Skills, adaptive problem-solving was measured instead of problem-solving in 
a technology-rich environment. Adaptive problem solving was defined as: “the capacity to achieve one’s 
goals in a dynamic situation in which a method for solution is not immediately available. It requires 
engaging in cognitive and metacognitive processes to define the problem, search for information, and apply 
a solution in a variety of information environments and contexts” (OECD, 2024[10]). 
3 On average, literacy and numeracy skills decreased compared to 2012 for a weighted sample of data 
from Austria, Flemish Region (Belgium), Canada, Czechia, Denmark, England (United Kingdom), Estonia, 
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the 
Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden and the United States 
4 However, caution should be taken when extrapolating from the wage-skills link to the productivity-skills 
relationship, as recent literature questions the equivalence between wages and productivity (Caplin et al., 
2023[82]). 
5 Even if skills do not decline with age, people who are young today may have lower information-processing 
skills today and when they are older compared to young people of the future, e.g. if the future generations 
have higher educational attainment. 
6 The second cycle of the Survey of Adult Skills, was designed to ensure the results are comparable with 
those of the first cycle. However, some innovations have been introduced to improve the content, design 
and delivery of the assessment and, as a result, the assessments in both cycles are not identical. Please 
see (OECD, 2024[10]) for more detailed information about methodological changes between the cycles. 
7 Policy response is also needed to prevent the overall decline in information-processing skills, which might 
be due to e.g. lower quality of education that focuses on standardised tests rather than developing critical 
thinking and analytical skills, a decline in attention spans due to consumption of fast digital content or other 
impact of technological change. 
8 Older workers (45-65 year-olds) are approximately 2 percentage points less likely to be over-qualified 
than younger workers (25-44 year-olds) on average, though this pattern is not statistically significant in 
many countries. 
9 The average age of the working population rose by 3.3 years during 1980 through 2005. 
10 However, this pattern may be the result of older workers being less likely to hold jobs that require the 
use of ICT even within the same 2-digit ISCO occupation and not necessarily because they lack the 
necessary skills. 
11 For example, among the 25-29 year-olds, earnings of the top 25% and top 10% earners are 40% and 
91% higher than of the median earners, respectively. In contrast, among the 60-65 year-olds, the top 25% 
earn 67% more than the median, and the top 10% earn 3 times the median.

12 Among workers in physically demanding occupations (elementary occupations, plant and machine 
operators and assemblers), more than 30% said they will not be able to continue working until the age of 
60, as compared to 20% among professionals and clerical support workers (EU-OSHA, Cedefop, 
Eurofound and EIGE, 2017[83]). 
13 However, it should be noted that less physically demanding jobs may still be associated with high stress 
levels, leading to burnout and other mental health problems affecting workers employability and 
productivity. 
14 The authors use Danish administrative data to study work accidents in a setting where individuals can 
either receive disability insurance payments or opt for rehabilitation benefits, which are set at the same 
level and are available to those who participate in formal education or vocational training with firms. Authors 
exploit differences in eligibility driven by prior vocational training and find that reskilled workers earn 24% 
more than before their injuries and do not end up on antidepressants. Reskilling subsidies for injured 
workers pay for themselves four times over. 
15 For comparison, participation in non-formal training among employed 60-65 year-olds is similar to the 
share of 60-65 year-olds who are learning by doing. 
16 Sum of those who participated in non-formal training and those who wanted to participate in training but 
did not. 
17 The average effective age of labour market exit is defined as the average age of exit from the labour 
force for workers aged 40 and over. 
18 Other factors, such as different age gaps in educational attainment between countries may also 
contribute to the age gap in training participation. Higher training participation may also lead to higher 
effective labour market exit age, as discussed in the subsequent paragraphs. 
19 In 2006, the Dutch Government abolished favourable tax treatment of early retirement plans for public 
sector employees born in 1950 or later. This resulted in a drop in pension benefits when workers retire 
early and stronger incentives to continue working (Montizaan, Cörvers and De Grip, 2010[39]). In Italy, 
starting from 1995, access to seniority pensions was tightened, and individuals were required not only to 
have 35 years of contributions (sufficient condition before the reform), but also to reach a minimum age, 
which was progressively increased to 57 (Brunello and Comi, 2015[40]). 
20 Average includes Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, 
New Zealand and the United States 
21 When designing and implementing ILA, it is essential to verify that training providers comply with 
minimum quality requirements to avoid fraud. It is also important to clearly define eligibility criteria to 
prevent beneficiaries from enrolling in leisure courses and to ensure that ILA-funded training is aligned 
with the scheme’s objectives. 
22 The effectiveness of the schemes that offer financial incentives to participate in training, whether they 
target employers or individuals, will depend on the exact design features and the context in which they 
operate. Therefore, it is critical that countries take an experimental approach to implementing such 
schemes, which involves continuous monitoring of their implementation, rigorous evaluation to assess 
whether the schemes achieve the desired impact in a cost-effective way and continuously adapting the 
scheme based on the results.

Productivity growth has slowed across OECD economies, and its benefits 
have become less equally shared. This chapter focuses on the role of 
growth-enhancing job reallocation in aggregate wage and productivity 
growth in the context of population ageing. Using detailed linked employer-
employee data from 17 OECD countries, it analyses how different types of 
worker movements contribute to the reallocation of workers towards firms 
paying higher wages and with higher productivity. The analysis 
distinguishes between job-to-job mobility, which often reflects voluntary 
career moves to better-paying firms, and employment flows in and out of 
work. Particular attention is put on how workforce ageing may affect these 
dynamics, given differences in mobility between younger and older workers. 
The chapter concludes with a discussion of policies that can support 
growth-enhancing job reallocation by providing sufficient flexibility to firms 
and promoting upward mobility for workers, especially mid-career and older 
ones.

In Brief 
Key findings 
Productivity growth – gross domestic product (GDP) per hour worked – has slowed across OECD 
economies, and its benefits have become less equally shared. Average annual productivity growth has 
fallen from just above 2% in the late 1990s to less than 1% in the 2010s. Average annual wage growth 
has followed a similar evolution but has been weaker than productivity growth, especially among lower-
wage workers, contributing to a declining labour share and increasing wage inequality, making growth 
less inclusive. Declining business dynamism, e.g. entry and exit of firms, job creation and destruction in 
continuing firms, may be one factor that has contributed to the slowdown and may partially be related to 
the difficulty of firms and workers in adapting to rapid and profound structural transformations in a context 
of population ageing. While productivity growth has been somewhat stronger since the COVID-19 crisis, 
notably in the United States, it is too early to tell whether this reflects a short-term bouncing back from 
the COVID-19 crisis or a change in the longer-term trend due to technological advances (digitalisation, 
AI) or changes in working practices (e.g. teleworking). 
This chapter provides new insights into how growth-enhancing job reallocation contributes to aggregate 
wage and productivity growth in the context of population ageing. It responds to concerns about the 
declining dynamism of labour markets in OECD countries and its consequences for aggregate wage 
and productivity growth. It also considers the potential role of population ageing for wage and productivity 
growth through lower mobility of older workers. Special emphasis is placed on the job ladder, i.e. the 
importance of voluntary transitions to more productive firms paying higher wages (“job-to-job mobility”). 
The empirical analysis is based on linked employer-employee data from 17 OECD countries for the 
period 2000-19: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, 
Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. 
Job-to-job mobility plays a key role in growth-enhancing job reallocation and hence aggregate wage and 
productivity growth 
• 
Growth-enhancing job reallocation primarily occurs through job-to-job mobility and to a much 
lower extent through movements in and out of employment (i.e. “employment mobility”). 
Although both types of mobility contribute equally to overall labour market dynamics, job-to-job 
transitions play a greater role in reallocating workers to higher-paying and more productive firms. 
This suggests that job-to-job moves are more often voluntary and career-driven, while mobility 
in and out of employment is more likely to be influenced by personal factors, such as decisions 
about labour force participation, or be involuntary. 
• 
Job-to-job mobility is a key driver of overall growth, contributing 0.9 percentage points annually 
to wage and productivity growth on average between 2000 and 2019. However, a large part of 
this is offset by the negative effects of employment mobility, mainly due to life cycle dynamics 
as young workers start their careers in low wage, low productivity firms. As a result, overall job 
reallocation, the joint contribution of job-to-job and employment mobility, adds 0.3 percentage 
points to average wage and productivity growth respectively (16% and 22% of total growth). 
• 
Cross-country differences in job reallocation are important for understanding cross-country 
differences in aggregate growth rates. Growth-enhancing job reallocation accounts for 44% of 
the cross-country variation in wage growth and 41% of the variation in productivity growth. The 
remainder is explained by differences in growth rates among workers who stay in the same firm, 
which in part may reflect the role of learning and innovation in the workplace. In countries with 

--- Page Break ---
248    
OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
high wage growth over the period considered (e.g. Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania), overall job 
reallocation plays a strong positive role, while in low-wage-growth countries (e.g. Belgium, 
France, Italy, Spain), its role is small or negative as the structure of employment shifts to lower 
wage firms and industries. 
Population ageing has tended to slow growth-enhancing job reallocation and contributed to weaker 
aggregate wage and productivity growth 
• 
Mid-career and older workers tend to be less mobile than younger workers and less likely to 
transition to higher-quality firms through the “job ladder”. As a result, workforce ageing may 
contribute to slow down aggregate wage and productivity growth. 
• 
Estimates suggest that, between the early 2000s and late 2010s, workforce ageing resulted in 
a slowdown of aggregate wage and productivity growth of, respectively, 0.13 and 
0.10 percentage points on average across countries (compared with an average annual 
aggregate growth rate of, respectively, 0.6 and 1.0% among the set of countries considered). 
Going forward, given current policies, the impact of population ageing on the share of older 
workers in employment is expected to be modest. 
• 
From a policy perspective, a key question is why workforce ageing tends to slow aggregate 
growth. It may reflect weaker incentives for job mobility because older workers feel that they 
have little to gain from changing employer, either because they have already climbed the job 
ladder or because they have fewer working years remaining in their careers. Alternatively, it may 
reflect larger barriers to job mobility among older workers, which keeps them locked in low 
productivity firms paying low wages. This would raise important concerns about the adaptability 
of the workforce to structural change and provide a case for developing policies that support job 
mobility toward higher wage and more productive firms among mid-career and older workers. 
• 
There are important differences in the distribution of employment for young and older workers 
across firms of varying quality (in terms of productivity or wage-setting practices). Younger 
workers tend to be concentrated in lower-quality firms than mid-career and older workers, and 
this pattern has become slightly more pronounced over time. This reflects the importance of the 
job ladder for integrating new cohorts of young workers in the labour market. There is no 
evidence that workforce ageing has influenced opportunities of younger workers for moving up 
the job ladder. 
Policies can support growth-enhancing job reallocation by providing sufficient flexibility to firms and 
promoting job mobility for workers 
• 
Policies should ensure that firms have sufficient flexibility to adapt to changing business 
conditions, while at the same time providing adequate security for workers. This includes 
maintaining balanced employment protection for open-ended contracts, as overly strict rules not 
only reduce dismissal risks but also discourage hiring, limiting job mobility. Overly strict 
employment protection for open-ended contracts may also incentivise the use of fixed-term 
contracts, which increases worker mobility without necessarily moving workers to better jobs. 
Job retention schemes offer firms flexibility to reduce working hours during downturns, 
strengthening labour market resilience. However, if used to respond to permanent structural 
shifts, they can impede efficiency-enhancing worker reallocation. 
• 
Policies should also remove unwarranted barriers to growth-enhancing job reallocation. This 
requires closer scrutiny of professional licensing regulations and the use of non-compete and 
other restraint clauses. While licensing helps to ensure service quality and non-compete clauses 
may protect legitimate business interests, their growing use may have negative impacts on 
competition and job reallocation. Voluntary certification, combined with consumer information

   249 
OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
systems, could serve as an alternative to strict licensing requirements. Limiting non-compete 
clauses to certain workers (e.g. high-wage employees) or imposing compensation and 
notification requirements may be warranted. Strict enforcement of such regulations is key. 
• 
A deeper understanding of how wage-setting institutions affect efficiency-enhancing reallocation 
is needed. Wage floors may reduce job mobility by compressing wages, making it harder for 
productive or newly created firms to attract workers. However, they can also force unproductive 
firms to downsize or exit – potentially moving workers to more productive firms and boosting 
overall productivity – as well as ensure fair wages for vulnerable workers with a weak bargaining 
position. To support productivity growth through job reallocation, policies limiting wage 
dispersion between firms should be paired with measures that enhance voluntary job mobility 
and drive innovation in low-productivity firms. 
• 
Policies should support the mobility of mid-career and older workers. While many older workers 
have already moved up the job ladder, some face barriers that keep them in low-quality firms or 
hinder reemployment in good jobs after job loss. Targeted interventions, such as early support 
measures and wage insurance, can help displaced workers transition effectively. Job-search 
assistance and career guidance are crucial, especially for those with limited recent mobility. 
Public employment and career guidance should not just cater to unemployed workers but also 
to employed workers who are stuck in low-quality jobs. Addressing skill obsolescence changing 
skill needs through training is also key to ensuring continued career progression. 
Introduction 
Productivity growth has slowed and become less inclusive across OECD economies. Since the early 
2000s, average annual hourly labour productivity growth has been weak, falling from just above 2% in the 
late 1990s to 1.4% in the 2000s and less than 1% in the 2010s (see Annex Table 5.A.1. ). In several 
countries, the benefits of productivity growth have also become less evenly distributed, with wage growth, 
particularly for workers in the bottom half of the wage distribution, lagging behind even modest productivity 
gains. This has contributed to declining labour shares and increasing wage inequality in many countries. 
These developments partially reflect the difficulty of firms and workers in adapting to rapid and profound 
structural transformations (e.g. digital transformation, automation, net-zero transition) in a context of 
population ageing. Indeed, it is possible that workforce ageing due to its implications for learning and 
mobility has made it harder to adjust to structural change at a time when the need for adaptability is 
particularly high, with potentially important implications for future growth (Maestas, Mullen and Powell, 
2023[1]) – see also Chapter 4. All in all, there are important questions about the ability of OECD economies 
to generate rising standards of living and well-being in a context of rapid structural changes and ageing 
populations. This has led to the development of far-ranging proposals to revive broadly shared productivity 
growth (e.g. Draghi (2024[2])). 
Job mobility between firms can play a particularly important role in reviving broadly shared productivity 
gains in a context of an ageing workforce by promoting a more efficient allocation of resources across firms 
that differ in their productivity and wage-setting practices. Labour markets that are able to allocate workers 
to their most productive uses are typically also better able to support structural transformation and less 
likely to be characterised by persistent labour shortages. However, the process of efficiency-enhancing 
reallocation may be significantly affected by workforce ageing if older workers are less likely to transition 
to more productive higher-paying firms than younger workers. Older workers face higher costs and fewer 
benefits when changing employer. They risk losing job security, while potential wage increases are less 
valuable to them since they have fewer working years remaining in their careers. Consequently, there is a 
risk that older workers get stuck in jobs with limited prospects for career advancement, reinforcing labour

OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
shortages and undermining the ability of high-performance firms to grow and flourish (OECD, 2024[3]) – 
see also Chapters 3 and 4. 
As argued in the OECD Employment Outlook of 2022, job mobility between firms also has potentially 
important implications for the sharing of productivity gains with workers by containing the wage-setting 
power of firms and reducing wage gaps between firms (OECD, 2022[4]). The extent to which job mobility 
can contribute to a broader sharing of productivity gains and lower wage inequality depends crucially on 
the extent to which opportunities for job mobility are equally shared between different groups of workers. 
When opportunities for upward mobility are skewed towards workers with higher skills, there is a risk that 
job mobility deepens wage inequalities. Opportunities for moving up the job ladder may also be affected 
unevenly by workforce ageing for different groups of workers. To the extent that ageing results in lower 
turnover in good firms, it may reduce job opportunities for younger workers to move to better firms. 
However, to the extent that older workers have skills that complement those of younger workers, it is also 
possible that ageing increases opportunities for young workers, particularly in firms where firm-specific 
human capital is important (Carta, D’Amuri and Wachter, 2021[5]). 
This chapter aims to enhance our understanding of aggregate wage and productivity growth through 
growth-enhancing job reallocation and the consequences of workforce ageing. Specific emphasis is given 
to the nature of job mobility (see Box 5.1 for a glossary of the mobility concepts used) by distinguishing 
between job-to-job mobility (direct flows between jobs in different firms), which is more likely to be voluntary 
and often driven by career considerations, and employment mobility (flows in and out of employment), 
which is more likely to be involuntary or driven by personal considerations (e.g. labour force participation 
decisions). This distinction is important because voluntary job mobility requires policies that tackle barriers 
of workers to changing employer and involuntary mobility requires policies that provide flexibility to firms 
by allowing them to adjust employment levels in line with changing business conditions. The empirical 
analysis is based on linked employer-employee data from 17 OECD countries for the period 2000-19: 
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.1 Such data crucially allow documenting 
the role of job mobility in efficiency-enhancing reallocation across a diverse set of OECD economies, while 
assessing the extent to which this is shaped by workforce ageing. 
The chapter is structured in three sections. Section 5.1 sets the scene by presenting key stylised facts 
related to the evolution of aggregate productivity, wages and wage inequality over the past two decades 
as well as that of labour market dynamism based on different measures of job mobility. Section 5.2 focuses 
on the importance of job-to-job and employment mobility for growth-enhancing job reallocation in general, 
as well as in the context of workforce ageing. It considers how moves from one employer to another, as 
well as moves in and out of employment, contribute to a changing structure of employment from less 
productive, or lower paying, firms to more productive, or higher paying, firms, and therefore contributes to 
wage and productivity growth. By looking at the worker-level trajectory across firms, it also sheds light on 
the implications of voluntary versus involuntary job mobility for aggregate wage and productivity growth. A 
key part of this section is dedicated to the differences in job mobility across age groups and the implications 
that workforce ageing may have for aggregate wage and productivity growth. Section 5.3 discusses how 
policies and institutions can revive broadly shared productivity growth through growth-enhancing 
reallocation by focusing on policies that determine the flexibility of firms and policies that support mobility 
to better firms for workers, including for mid-career and older workers.

Box 5.1. Mobility concepts 
This chapter includes several mobility concepts that are laid out below. Each of these concepts is 
measured using annual linked employer-employee data (see Annex Table 5.A.3 for details), expressed 
as a share of private-sector non-agricultural dependent employment (average between previous and 
current year) and calculated in “excess” terms to abstract from changes in aggregate employment.1 
While the source data tend to be very comprehensive, often covering the population of workers and 
firms, much of the analysis is based on large random samples (typically 20% of firms). 
Gross worker mobility 
Gross worker mobility or gross worker flows (𝐺𝑡) is defined as the sum of hires and separations in a 
country between two periods and includes gross job-to-job mobility and gross employment mobility. 
Gross job-to-job mobility refers to the sum of hires (𝐻𝐽𝑡) and separations (𝑆𝐽𝑡) through direct transitions 
between firms from one year to the next. Gross employment mobility refers to the sum of hires from 
outside private-sector employment (𝐻𝑁𝑡) and separations out of private-sector employment (𝑆𝑁𝑡). 
Workers not employed in the private sector may be employed in the public sector, self-employed, 
unemployed or inactive. Gross worker mobility consists of worker churn, i.e. the presence of 
simultaneous hires and separations within firms that are not associated with net employment changes 
in firms, and job flows, i.e. differences between hires and separations in firms that are associated with 
changes in net employment. This is one of the two concepts used in Section 5.2. Formally, it can be

Gross job mobility or gross job reallocation 
Gross job mobility (𝑅𝑡), also referred to as gross job reallocation, is defined as the sum of job creation 
and destruction across firms in the private sector during a specific period. Job creation refers to the 
sum of all employment gains at expanding firms between one year and the next (∆𝐸𝑖𝑡≥0), while job 
destruction refers to the sum of employment losses in contracting firms (∆𝐸𝑖𝑡< 0) (expressed in its 
absolute value). Job flows represent a subset of worker flows that result in changes in net employment 
at the firm level (denoted by 𝑖), but do not account for churn, i.e. simultaneous hires and separations in 
firms that do not change the level of employment in a firm.2 Gross job mobility is the second concept 
used in Section 5.2. Formally, it can be expressed as: 
𝑅𝑡= ∑∆𝐸𝑖𝑡
∆𝐸𝑖𝑡≥0

𝐽𝑜𝑏 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

Net job mobility 
Net job mobility refers to changes in the structure of employment across firms or groups of firms that 
differ in their productivity or wage-setting practices. For example, when grouping firms in productivity 
classes (e.g. quintiles of the productivity distribution), net job mobility (𝑁𝐽𝑞,𝑡) refers to the difference in 
hires and separations in that productivity class 𝑞 in period 𝑡. It therefore does not take account of 
mobility between firms with similar levels of productivity or flows between low and high productivity firms

that cancel each other out. Net job mobility can be decomposed into net job-to-job mobility and net 
employment mobility, depending on whether hires and separations relate to direct movements between 
employers or movements in and out employment. This is the concept used in Section 5.2 (see Box 5.3. 
for further details). Formally, net job mobility in group 𝑄 can be expressed as:

1. The analysis excludes the public sector and self-employment for methodological consistency, as public sector employment is not recorded 
across all countries. 
2. Gross job mobility also does not take account of the direction of flows along the distribution of wages and productivity. This is considered 
in the definition of net job mobility.  
5.1. Setting the scene 
This section provides key stylised facts related to the evolution of aggregate wage and productivity growth, 
labour market dynamism, as measured by the process of job reallocation between firms, and the possible 
role of workforce ageing. 
5.1.1. Growth has weakened and become less broadly shared 
Labour productivity growth has been on a declining trend since the 1970s (André, Gal and Schief, 2024[6]; 
Goldin et al., 2024[7]) and has been particularly weak since the early 2000s (Figure 5.1, Panel A and 
Figure 5.2). While in the United States, productivity growth picked up briefly during the mid-1990s thanks 
to investments in ICT, the boom did not last and growth has been weak since the mid-2000s (Gordon and 
Sayed, 2020[8]). In other advanced economies, productivity growth has been on a secular downward trend 
from the early 1990s as the boom-and-bust cycle related to ICT was less pronounced or even absent. On 
average across countries, labour productivity growth declined from 2.1% during 1995-2002, to 1.4% during 
2002-10 and 0.9% during 2010-19. Productivity growth has been marginally stronger since the COVID-19 
crisis in about half of the OECD countries, and more notably so in the United States. However, it is too 
early to tell whether this reflects a short-term effect of the COVID-19 crisis or a change in the longer-term 
trend due to technological developments (digitalisation, AI) and changes in working practices 
(e.g. teleworking). 
The long-term decline in productivity growth is typically attributed to a slowdown in multifactor productivity 
(MFP) growth, i.e. the slower pace of advancements in efficiency with which capital and labour are used 
in the production process. This may either reflect the pace of learning and innovation in the workplace, 
including through the adoption of more advanced production technologies and management practices, or 
the speed with which capital and labour are reallocated from less to more efficient firms. Baqaee and Farhi 
(2020[9]) show for the United States that each account for about half of productivity growth and its 
slowdown. In principle, both may be affected by population ageing if the productivity of older workers grows 
more slowly than that of younger workers or if older workers are less likely to move to more efficient firms. 
Ageing may also shift the structure of consumption towards less efficient, lower productivity sectors such 
as healthcare and leisure (André, Gal and Schief, 2024[6]). There is some indication that the process of 
efficiency-enhancing job reallocation between sectors has slowed as consumer services have gained in 
importance (see Annex Figure 5.A.1). Since the global financial crisis, weak MFP growth has been 
compounded by a reduced pace of capital deepening due to a prolonged decline in investment.

Labour productivity growth has also become less broadly shared (Figure 5.1, Panel B, and Figure 5.2). 
Declining productivity growth has not only led to weakening average wage growth but in addition average 
wage growth has increasingly fallen short of already weak productivity growth, resulting in a declining share 
of labour in national income.2 Average wage growth for the OECD as a whole has declined from 1.6% 
during 1995-2002, to 1.0% during 2002-10 and 0.8% during 2010-19 and been consistently weaker than 
growth in labour productivity. Various factors may have contributed to the decline in the labour share, 
including capital-augmenting technological change, the rise in product market concentration, the decline 
in the bargaining position of workers or changes in the composition of firms due to reallocation 
(Karabarbounis, 2024[10]). Growth-enhancing reallocation has been shown to reduce the labour share 
because more productive firms also tend to be more capital intensive, see e.g. Autor et al. (2020[11]), 
Schwellnus et al. (2018[12]), and Cho et al. (2025[13]). The decline in the labour share has coincided with 
rising wage inequality, as median wage growth has failed to keep up with average wage growth (Figure 5.1 
Panel C, and Figure 5.2). Median wage growth for the OECD as a whole amounted to just 0.5% during 
2002-10 and 0.4% during 2010-19. In some countries, including Japan and the United Kingdom, median 
wage growth even has turned slightly negative.

5.1.2. Slower growth may in part reflect a decline in the pace of growth-enhancing job 
reallocation between firms 
Weaker aggregate wage and productivity growth can stem from declining growth within firms, for example 
due to changes in the pace of innovation, technology adoption and skill development, or from changes in 
how labour reallocates between firms that differ in their wage-setting practices or productivity (see 
definition in Box 5.1). While the main focus of this chapter is on the latter, Box 5.2 provides some stylised 
facts on the evolution of within-firm productivity growth. 
In many OECD countries, there has been a decline over time in economic dynamism, as measured by the 
rate of gross job reallocation between firms, with potentially important implications for aggregate wage and 
productivity growth (Figure 5.3). Job reallocation has significantly declined from 29% in 1990 to 23% in 
2022, from 23% in 2002 to 17% in 2019 in Canada, from 18% in 2001 to 16% in 2019 in New Zealand and 
from 25% in 2003 to 21% in 2019 on average across selected Euro area countries. These stylised facts 
are broadly in line with previous evidence for the United States (Decker et al., 2020[14]) and a subset of 
OECD countries (Cho, Manaresi and Reinhard, 2025[13]; Causa, Luu and Abendschein, 2021[15]). To the 
extent that high-wage and high-productivity firms are typically more likely to expand and low-wage and 
low-productivity firms more likely to contract, the decline in gross job reallocation may also have slowed 
aggregate wage and productivity growth. 
Given its potential implications for aggregate wage and productivity growth, the decline in job reallocation 
raises important policy questions. A first question is whether this reflects reduced returns to job reallocation, 
as differences in productivity and wages between firms have tended to narrow, for example due to declining 
volatility in product markets, or alternatively, increased costs to job reallocation, weakening the 
responsiveness of firm employment to changes in productivity. While developments vary across countries,

the evidence suggests that disparities in productivity and wages among firms have, if anything, increased 
(Andrews, Criscuolo and Gal, 2016[16]; Berlingieri, Blanchenay and Criscuolo, 2017[17]; OECD, 2022[4]). If 
so, a decline in the pace of job reallocation is more likely to reflect a change in responsiveness. A second 
question is to what extent a reduced responsiveness of firm employment reflects greater costs on the side 
of firms associated with adjusting employment levels to changing business conditions or greater barriers 
on the side of workers to changing employers. The latter may reflect, among others, the role of skills or 
geographical mismatches and employers’ market power but also the role of workforce ageing for labour 
shortages.

firms on average between the current and previous year. Gross job reallocation rates are calculated in “excess” terms to abstract from changes 
in aggregate employment. For more details on the definition of gross job reallocation, see Box 5.1. Euro Area (EA): average for Austria, Estonia,

Box 5.2. The slowdown in productivity growth within firms in selected OECD countries 
This box complements the analysis of between-firm productivity growth through job reallocation with 
descriptive statistics on within-firm productivity growth based on data from five OECD countries. More 
specifically, it compares within firm-productivity growth in the first year available before the global 
financial crisis and the last year before the COVID-19 crisis on average across countries and firms or 
specific groups of firms. 
There is some indication that within-firm productivity growth has slightly declined in the period 
considered for the selected countries. On average across countries, within-firm productivity growth 
amounted to 2.7% in the early 2000s and 2.3% in the late 2010s (Figure 5.4). 
The decline in within-firm productivity growth is primarily driven by large frontier firms in manufacturing. 
Productivity growth in frontier firms, defined as those in the top 10% of the employment-weighted firm 
distribution, fell sharply from just above 4.6% to almost -1.3%, while it also slowed among large firms 
and firms in manufacturing. At the same time, lagging firms (the other 90%), small firms and firms in

the services sector saw slight increases in within-firm productivity growth. While these figures hide 
substantial heterogeneity across countries, the decline in dynamism among frontier firms is present in 
all countries considered. 
These stylised facts suggest that to understand the decline in broadly shared productivity gains, it is 
not sufficient to focus on growth-enhancing reallocation, but attention should also be given to factors 
that determine within-firm productivity growth such as learning, innovation and technology adoption.

5.1.3. Workforce ageing tends to slow worker mobility 
Demographic developments in the form of workforce ageing and declining youth cohorts have tended to 
weigh down on worker mobility and are expected to slow mobility further in the coming decades (Figure 5.5). 
On average across countries, more than one in two workers changed employer or employment status from 
one year to the next (see Box 5.1 for details). However, older workers are much less likely to change job 
status than younger workers. Only 37% of older workers aged 55-74 change employer or employment 
status from one year to the next, compared with 54% for workers aged 15-54. Consequently, both workforce 
ageing and declining youth cohorts drag down mobility (see also André, Gal and Schief (2024[6]) and 
Engbom (2019[18])). On average across countries, and assuming no change in age-specific mobility 
(admittedly, a strong assumption),3 changes in the age of structure of employment reduced worker mobility 
by 1.6 percentage points between 2000 and 2022 and is expected to further lower mobility between 2022 
and 2060 by 0.4 percentage points based on population and employment projections. The overall decline 
in worker mobility due to workforce ageing between 2000 and 2060 is expected to amount to 2 percentage 
points or almost 4%. The decline is entirely driven by direct job-to-job mobility between firms, i.e. transitions

without intermediate spells out of work. Employment mobility i.e. transitions in and out employment 
(including those related to decisions to participate in the labour force) slightly increased but is expected to 
remain broadly constant from now on. These overall patterns reflect the fact that older workers are much 
less likely than younger workers to change employer voluntarily. However, as will be shown in the next 
section, this is precisely the type of mobility that is most relevant for growth-enhancing job reallocation.

in private-sector firms on average between the current and previous year. Gross job-to-job mobility: the total number of hires and separations related 
to transitions between employers from one year to the next (without an intermediate year out of work). Gross employment mobility: the total number 
of hires and separations related to transitions in and out of employment from one year to the next. Gross mobility is measured in excess terms which 
means that only hires and separations over and above those needed to accommodate changes in aggregate employment are taken into account.

This section documents the importance of job mobility for growth-enhancing job reallocation and its 
implications for aggregate wage and productivity growth in the context of an ageing workforce. It starts by 
looking at the role of job mobility in growth-enhancing job reallocation and aggregate wage and productivity 
growth using annual linked employer-employee data for 17 countries for the period 2000-19.4 It then 
proceeds by drawing out the implications of workforce ageing for the evolution of wage and productivity 
growth between 2001 and 2019.

5.2.1. Job mobility, job reallocation and growth 
Efficiency-enhancing job reallocation is defined as the reallocation of labour towards more productive firms. 
Since this increases the weight of more productive firms in the economy, it raises aggregate productivity.5 
Since more productive firms tend to pay higher wages, changes in the structure of employment towards 
more productive firms may also be wage-enhancing. However, the link between wages and productivity 
across firms is far from perfect (OECD, 2022[4]).6 Job reallocation between firms that differ in their pay 
practices may therefore look somewhat different from that between firms that differ in their productivity and 
yield important insights about the extent to which job mobility contributes to the career progression of 
workers, aggregate wage growth and improvements in the living standards of workers. This section 
therefore considers both wage and productivity-enhancing job reallocation. It refers to the general process 
of reallocation towards more productive firms or higher-paying firms as growth-enhancing reallocation. 
Growth-enhancing job reallocation mainly takes place through job-to-job mobility 
Job reallocation tends to shift employment towards higher paying and higher productivity firms (Figure 5.6). 
The difference in average annual employment growth in the bottom 20% of incumbent firms7 in terms of 
wages and productivity and aggregate average annual employment growth is consistently negative, 
whereas it is consistently positive in the top 20% of incumbent firms. In other words, employment is 
continuously being reallocated from low-wage, low-productivity firms to high-wage, high-productivity firms, 
contributing to higher aggregate wage and productivity growth. A detailed description of the methodology 
used here can be found in Box 5.3. 
Box 5.3. Methodology I: Growth-enhancing job reallocation 
Growth-enhancing job reallocation is defined as the change in the structure of employment from lower 
quality to higher quality firms, either in terms of wages or productivity. In practice, it is measured by the 
coefficient from an employment-weighted firm-level regression of employment growth (∆𝐸𝑗𝑡) on lagged 
firm quality (𝜋𝑗𝑡−1), lagged employment (𝐸𝑗𝑡−1) and a set of fixed effects (𝛿) (Decker et al., 
2020[14]).1 Since the model can only be estimated for incumbent firms, firm entry is ignored. Firm quality 
may be measured in terms of log labour productivity (value added per worker or, if not available, sales 
per worker) or average log wages.1 To reduce the role of measurement error, firm quality is averaged 
between 𝑡−1 and 𝑡−3.  Firm quality may be measured as a continuous variable or dummies for 
quintiles of the distribution.2 Formally, this yields: 
∆𝐸𝑗𝑡= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝜋𝑗𝑡−1 + 𝛽2𝐸𝑗𝑡−1 + 𝛿𝑠𝑡+ 𝜀𝑗𝑡 
where employment growth in firm j is defined as the change in employment divided by the average level 
of employment between the current and previous year. Employment growth can be replaced by either 
the contribution to employment growth of job-to-job mobility or the contribution to employment growth 
of employment mobility. 
Equation (1) is estimated separately with industry-by-year fixed effects and just year fixed effects. The 
estimated coefficient on firm quality in the regression with industry fixed effects, 𝛽1, provides an 
indication of the speed of growth-enhancing job reallocation within industries, while the coefficient in 
the regression without industry fixed effects provides an indication of the speed of the overall process 
across firms no matter their industry. The role of growth-enhancing job reallocation between industries 
can be obtained by taking the difference between these two coefficients. 

--- Page Break ---
   259 
OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK 2025 © OECD 2025 
  
The coefficients on firm quality are normalised by the standard deviation of firm quality in the 
corresponding year to enhance their comparability across countries or age groups. This takes account 
of the fact that the speed of growth-enhancing job reallocation depends not only on the responsiveness 
of employment growth to firm quality but also the dispersion of firm quality between firms. The model is 
estimated for the full sample as well as for sample splits by year, broad sector (manufacturing, services), 
age group and gender. 
1. Note that measuring firm quality in terms of wages and labour productivity ignores several other aspects of firm quality that can be 
important for job mobility such as job security, the quality of the working environment, and geographical proximity (Cazes, Hijzen and Saint-
Martin, 2015[21]; Sorkin, 2018[22]; Le Barbanchon, Rathelot and Roulet, 2021[23]). 
2. Results based on dummies for quintiles of the firm-distribution of wages and productivity are expressed in deviation from the aggregate 
employment growth rate, ensuring that the sum of the coefficients on the quintile dummies equals zero. 
The shift in the structure of employment towards higher wage and higher productivity firms mainly takes place 
through job-to-job mobility, while the contribution of employment mobility is relatively minor. This insight is 
based on the decomposition of wage and productivity-enhancing job reallocation in its contributions related 
to job-to-job mobility, which is likely to be voluntary, and those related to employment mobility, i.e. movements 
in and out of private sector-dependent employment. The latter reflects a range of factors, such as the decision 
to participate in the labour force, the risk of unemployment and the choice of working in the public sector or 
being self-employed. The bulk of growth-enhancing job reallocation is driven by job-to-job mobility rather than 
employment mobility. This is despite job-to-job mobility and employment mobility being approximately equally 
important in overall worker mobility.8 It suggests that job-to-job mobility is more likely to be voluntary and 
driven by wage considerations, whereas employment mobility is more likely to be involuntary or driven by 
personal considerations, including the decision to participate in the labour force. The positive role of job-to-
job mobility in growth-enhancing job reallocation is sometimes interpreted as a job ladder at work, i.e. the 
process through which workers climb the rungs of the ladder as they advance in their careers. 
The importance of the job ladder is a highly robust stylised fact. First, it is present in all countries considered 
irrespective of ranking of firms on wages or productivity. Second, it is robust to different modelling choices. 
Whereas the present results use the country-wide distribution to rank firms, consistent with the aggregate 
growth decompositions discussed below, results are quantitatively similar when focusing on the average 
pattern within detailed industries, indicating that firm quality plays only a limited a role for between-industry 
reallocation. This suggests that job reallocation between industries is not predominantly driven by efficiency 
differences, but rather by changes in the structure of product demand (e.g. the growing demand for 
consumer services due to population ageing). The results are also similar when focusing on the correlation 
between net employment growth and firm quality as in Decker et al. (2020[14]) instead of quintiles of the firm-
quality distribution. Third, the results presented here are consistent with previous evidence for the 
United States (Haltiwanger et al., 2018[24]), France and Italy (Berson, de Philippis and Viviano, 2020[25]), 
Denmark (Bertheau and Vejlin, 2024[26]) and Norway (Hijzen, Lillehagen and Zwysen, 2024[27]).9

average annual change in the structure of private sector non-agricultural dependent employment across quintiles of the employment-weighted

(Equation 1). Firms are ranked based on the moving average in wages and productivity over the previous three years. As an example, it shows 
that net employment growth in the least productive firms is about 6.7% lower than aggregate employment growth, of which 4.9 percentage points 
are due to job-to-job mobility and 1.8 percentage points due to employment mobility. For more details, see Box 5.3.Unweighted average across

Job-to-job mobility accounts for a sizeable part of aggregate wage and productivity growth, 
while that of overall job reallocation is more modest 
Aggregate wage and productivity growth reflects a combination of within-firm growth – increases in wages 
and productivity driven by workers who remain in the same firm from one year to the next (i.e. “stayers”) – 
and between-firm growth – increases in wages and productivity driven by the reallocation of workers across 
firms through job-to-job and employment mobility (i.e. “job reallocation)”. We now analyse how much of 
aggregate wage and productivity growth is accounted for by job reallocation between firms, including its 
components related to job-to-job mobility and employment mobility, and how much by within-firm growth. 
A detailed description of the methodology used here can be found in Box 5.4. 
By shifting the structure of employment to high wage and high productivity firms, job-to-job mobility plays a 
significant role in aggregate wage and productivity growth (Figure 5.7). On average across countries, job-to-

job mobility contributes 0.9 percentage points to average annual wage and productivity growth (which, in 
contrast to Figure 5.6, here also includes wages and productivity in entering firms). While the contribution of 
job-to-job mobility is considerable, it is largely offset by the negative contribution of employment mobility. This 
mainly reflects life cycle effects that arise as young workers start their careers in low wage and low 
productivity firms. Consequently, the large contribution of job-to-job mobility primarily reflects its role in 
integrating new entrants into the labour market. On net, overall job reallocation, which is the sum of job-to-
job and employment mobility, contributes 0.3 percentage points to aggregate wage and productivity growth 
(respectively, 16% and 22% of total growth). The remaining part reflects wage and productivity growth within 
continuing worker-firm matches (“stayers”). The importance of job-to-job mobility for aggregate wage growth 
is consistent with previous findings by Hahn, Hyatt and Janicki (2021[28]) for the United States and Hijzen 
et al. (2024[27]) for Norway. 
Box 5.4. Methodology II: Decomposing aggregate growth 
The contribution of the different types of labour market mobility to aggregate wage and productivity 
growth (∆𝑦𝑡) between t and t-1 is documented using a worker-level decomposition following Hahn, Hyatt 
and Janicki (2021[28]). In each period t, and for each worker i, dummy variables capture the mobility 
state for job stayers (𝑟𝑖𝑡), job-to-job movers (𝑗𝑖𝑡), hires from non-employment (ℎ𝑁𝑖𝑡) and separations to 
non-employment (𝑠𝑁𝑖𝑡). The total number of each worker type is further defined as 𝑅𝑡, 𝐽𝑡, 𝐻𝑁𝑡, and 𝑆𝑁𝑡, 
respectively. The number of workers employed in period 𝑡−1 is then 𝐸𝑡−1 =  𝑅𝑡+ 𝐽𝑡+ 𝑆𝑁𝑡 and 
𝐸𝑡=  𝑅𝑡+ 𝐽𝑡+  𝐻𝑁𝑡 in period 𝑡.1 With this, ∆𝑦𝑡 can be decomposed into the contributions of different 
labour market mobility types:

where 𝑦𝑖𝑡 denotes the firm quality (average wage or productivity) for individual i and year t and 𝑦𝑡̃  a 
reference level for firm quality for non-employed workers based on a weighted average for stayers and 
job-to-job movers:

In contrast to the firm-level analysis of growth-enhancing job reallocation, the worker-level decomposition 
of aggregate wage growth is not restricted to workers in incumbent firms and therefore also includes 
workers in entering firms. In addition, it measures firm wages and productivity in period t, rather than as 
an average between 𝑡−1 and 𝑡−3 and is performed on the universe of workers (where available). 
1. Note that job stayers (𝑅𝑡) and job-to-job movers (Jt) do not change total employment between period t-1 and t. Any changes in total 
employment represent hires from non-employment (𝐻𝑁𝑡) and separations to non-employment (𝑆𝑁𝑡). 
The contribution of job-to-job mobility to aggregate wage and productivity growth is particularly strong in 
good times, in line with the literature (Haltiwanger et al., 2018[24]). Its contribution to aggregate wage growth 
is 1.2 percentage points in periods of below-average cyclical unemployment compared with 0.6 percentage 
points in periods of above-average cyclical unemployment. Similarly, its contribution to aggregate 
productivity growth is 1.0 percentage point in periods of below-average cyclical unemployment compared 
with 0.7 percentage points in periods of above-average cyclical unemployment. This shows that the job 
ladder slows during periods of high unemployment. This is sometimes referred to as the “sullying effect” of 
recessions as this slows the speed of job reallocation (Haltiwanger et al., 2025[29]). In the literature, there 
is also some indication that recessions have a “cleansing effect” that increases the speed of job reallocation 
by destroying jobs in low-quality firms (Haltiwanger et al., 2025[29]). Wage growth among job stayers also 
slows during periods of high unemployment. This may in part reflect reduced worker bargaining power as

workers may be at greater risk of losing their job and face fewer opportunities of moving to a better job. In 
contrast, labour shortages during the initial years following the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with 
stronger wage growth through job-to-job mobility as the competition for workers increased, while high 
inflation depressed wage growth among all workers (see Box 5.5). 
It is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the long-term evolution of the contribution of net job-to-job 
mobility to aggregate wage and productivity growth due to the relatively short period considered here. 
Decker et al. (2020[14]) show for the United States that firm-level employment in the 2000s was 
considerably less responsive to productivity differences across firms than in the 1980s and that this 
reduced aggregate productivity growth by a non-trivial amount of about 2 to 3%. They argue that this 
reflects increases in the cost of adjusting employment for firms rather than changes in the need for job 
reallocation in response to changes in business opportunities. Similarly, Baksy, Caratelli and Engbom 
(2024[30]) show using CPS data for the United States that wage-enhancing job reallocation through job-to-
job mobility decreased during the period 1979-2023 and that this reduced average annual wage growth by 
1 percentage point, with most of the decline taking place before the 2000s. They argue that this is not 
because workers are better matched in recent years but rather that increased labour market concentration 
reduced the ability of workers to transition to higher paying firms.10

Box 5.5. Labour shortages and job reallocation in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis in Austria 
While labour shortages were already present prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in high-skill 
sectors, the recovery from the pandemic saw a rapid intensification (OECD, 2024[31]; 2024[32]; Causa 
et al., 2025[33]). This gap in labour demand and supply may have had significant implications for job 
mobility and wage dynamics. To analyse these issues, this box provides a decomposition of aggregate 
real wage growth in each detailed industry in the aftermath of the pandemic into components related to 
on-the job wage growth, and those related to job-to-job mobility and employment mobility using quarterly 
data between Q1 2022 and Q4 2023 for Austria. Note that average wage growth tended to be negative 
during this period due to the impact of energy price shocks on inflation. 
Industry differences in average quarterly real wage growth during the post-COVID-19 period in Austria 
are to a large part explained by differences in the contribution of job-to-job mobility (Figure 5.8). These 
are typically manufacturing industries characterised by significant labour shortages. Labour shortages 
increase competition between firms for employed workers, with high productivity firms poaching workers 
from low productivity firms, generating a strong job ladder. There is also some indication that wage 
growth among stayers was stronger in high-wage industries. In part, this is mechanical since stayers 
comprise the majority of workers in an industry. However, it may also partially reflect the role of labour 
shortages on the bargaining position of stayers.

Cross-country growth differences reflect a combination of within and between-firm growth 
A key question is to what extent differences in growth-enhancing job reallocation can account for the large 
variation in aggregate growth rates across countries. To look at this important issue, we assess to what 
extent cross-country differences in aggregate wage and productivity growth reflect differences in within-
firm growth (“stayers”) or between-firm growth (“job reallocation”), and the extent to which differences in 
between-firm growth rates are driven by differences in the contributions of job-to-job and employment 
mobility (Figure 5.9) – see Box 5.6. 
In countries with high wage growth (Panel A), such as Estonia, Hungary, Norway and Lithuania, the 
positive contribution of job reallocation is particularly important, whereas in countries with low wage growth 
such as Belgium, France, Italy and Spain, the contribution of job reallocation tends to be negative.11 Among 
the countries with information on labour productivity (Panel B), job reallocation contributes negatively in 
Finland, Italy and Portugal. Negative contributions of job reallocation are likely to reflect the shift in 
employment towards lower wage or productivity industries rather than that of reallocation towards lower 
wage or productivity firms within industries. Italy stands out as a country with negative aggregate 
productivity growth due to negative on-the-job productivity growth. 
To quantify the part of the cross-country variation that can be explained by the different components 
presented in Figure 5.9, supplemental “beta values” are calculated (Annex Figure 5.A.2), following Fujita 
and Ramey (2009[34]).12 This suggests that about 56% of the cross-country variation in aggregate wage 
growth is accounted for by on-the-job wage growth and 44% by job reallocation of which almost half (20%) 
is accounted for by job-to-job mobility.13 Similarly, about 59% of the cross-country variation in aggregate 
productivity growth is accounted for by within-firm productivity growth and 41% by between firm-
productivity growth due to job reallocation, of which about two-thirds (27%) reflects the role of job-to-jo 
mobility. 
Cross-country differences in the importance of job reallocation and job-to-job mobility in aggregate wage 
and productivity growth may reflect different factors (Decker et al., 2020[14]). First, differences across 
countries may reflect differences in frictions that determine the responsiveness of firm employment to 
differences in average wages or and productivity. This may reflect frictions on the side of firms related to 
the costs of adjusting employment in line with business conditions or on the side of workers related to the 
costs of changing jobs. Second, differences across countries may reflect changes in the volatility of 
business conditions (i.e. idiosyncratic productivity shocks). To the extent that volatility has declined, 
consistent with narratives before the global financial crisis of the “great moderation” (Clark, 2009[35]), this 
may have slowed the speed of job reallocation. Similarly, transition and emerging economies undergoing 
particularly fast structural change may see a higher speed of reallocation without necessarily having a 
higher responsiveness of firm-level employment to business conditions. Third, changes in the structure of 
employment towards high-wage or high productivity firms are more “valuable” in terms of aggregate growth 
in countries where differences in productivity and wages between firms are more important. The degree of 
dispersion between firms in a country depends to an important extent on the volatility of productivity shocks 
and the responsiveness of firms to changes in business conditions. 
To provide an indication of the importance of responsiveness in the cross-country variation in wage and 
productivity growth between firms, a counterfactual analysis is conducted that isolates the contribution of 
responsiveness from any other factors that contribute to between firm productivity and wage growth, 
following a similar exercise is conducted in Decker et al. (2020[14]) (see Box 5.6 for details). This exercise 
shows that responsiveness accounts for 51% of the cross-country variation in between-firm wage growth 
and 49% of the cross-country variation in between-firm productivity growth (Annex Figure 5.A.4). This 
indicates that frictions related to firms or workers account for a sizable component of cross-country 
differences in aggregate growth between firms.

Box 5.6. Methodology III: Comparing aggregate growth rates across countries 
The pace of growth-enhancing job reallocation depends both on initial conditions, i.e. the current 
allocation of jobs across firms, and the responsiveness of employment to firm quality, i.e. employment 
adjustment costs for firms and barriers to job mobility for workers. A convenient feature of the 
regression-based job reallocation model (Equation 1) is that it can be used to conduct counterfactual 
analyses of aggregate growth, keeping constant the estimated coefficient on firm quality 
(“responsiveness”) or the distribution of firm quality (“dispersion”). More specifically, the difference in 
aggregate growth (Δy) due to job reallocation between two countries 1 and 0 can be decomposed in a 
component that reflects differences in responsiveness (β) for a given distribution of firm quality and a 
component that reflects differences in the dispersion in firm quality (𝑋) for a given level of 
responsiveness, as follows: 
(3) 𝐸[∆𝑦1|𝑋1] −𝐸[∆𝑦0|𝑋0] = 𝛽1|𝑋1 −𝛽0|𝑋0 = [𝛽1|𝑋0 − 𝛽0|𝑋0]
⏟          
𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠
+ [𝛽1|𝑋1 − 𝛽1|𝑋0]
⏟          
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛
 
In practice, this decomposition is implemented in three steps, alternatively fixing the responsiveness or 
the level of dispersion. First, partial predictions of net employment growth, net job-to-job mobility and 
net employment mobility are retrieved for each quintile of the employment-weighted firm-quality 
distribution. Second, the corresponding employment shares for each segment of the employment-
weighted firm quality distribution are recalculated. Third, the contribution to aggregate growth is 
calculated by taking the employment-weighted average of firm quality across segments.1 
1. The decomposition presented in Equation 3 can alternatively be expressed using 𝛽0|𝑋1 as the counterfactual (i.e. using the 
responsiveness of country 0 and the level of dispersion in country 1). As both approaches can result in slightly different contributions of 
responsiveness and dispersion to differences in wage and productivity growth, the results of both counterfactual approaches are averaged. 
5.2.2. The role of workforce ageing 
This sub-section explores the influence of workforce ageing for growth-enhancing job reallocation as well 
as aggregate wage and productivity growth.14 
Older workers are less likely to transition to better firms 
The lower mobility of older workers was used in Section 5.1 of this chapter to draw out the implications of 
workforce ageing for the long-term evolution of gross worker mobility. In this section, the attention is instead 
placed on the extent to which an ageing workforce exhibits lower rates of net job mobility toward higher-
paying and more productive firms. This is analysed by focusing on the responsiveness of employment of 
a given age group to differences in firm wages or productivity (see Box 5.3). A positive correlation between 
firm employment growth and lagged firm quality suggests that the structure of employment shifts towards 
higher quality firms and hence that reallocation is growth-enhancing. This approach is preferred in the 
present case for expositional purposes as it is very synthetic. The results are very similar when focusing 
on employment growth by quintile of the firm-quality distribution as in the previous section. 
Older workers are not only less mobile but also less likely to transition to better firms in terms of average 
wages or and productivity (Figure 5.10). An increase of 10% in average firm wages (conditional on 
observed worker characteristics) is associated with an increase in firm-level employment growth of workers 
aged 15-24 of 1.0 percentage points, while a similar increase in labour productivity is associated with an 
increase of 0.7 percentage points in firm-level employment growth of young workers. This confirms the 
importance of job-to-job mobility for the careers of young workers and growth-enhancing job reallocation 
(Topel and Ward, 1992[36]; BLS, 2017[37]). The employment-growth response monotonically decreases with 
age. For workers aged 65-74, it even turns slightly negative due to the tendency of older workers to retire

from high quality firms. Differences in the employment-growth response mainly reflect differences in the 
role of job-to-job mobility in job reallocation, suggesting that the “job ladder”, through which workers move 
from lower to higher quality firms, operates more slowly for older workers. As a result, workforce ageing 
could have important implications for the speed of efficiency-enhancing reallocation and its contribution to 
aggregate wage and productivity growth.15 
Several factors may explain the lower responsiveness of employment growth to firm quality at older ages. 
First, the structure of older-worker employment across firms may be less sensitive to differences in firm 
quality because older workers face more important barriers or constraints to changing employers 
(e.g. home ownership, job security, social ties, family responsibilities; see Chapter 3). Older workers may 
also place a higher value on flexible working environments in terms of working time and location (OECD, 
2024[38]).16 Second, a lower responsiveness of employment growth to firm quality at older ages also may 
stem from higher costs of adjusting employment levels of older workers for employers, or because high 
quality employers prefer to hire younger workers (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of hiring discrimination 
against older workers). Third, older workers may also feel that they have little to gain from changing 
employers either because they have already climbed the job ladder, or because they have fewer working 
years remaining in their careers.

weighted firm-level regressions of employment growth on log firm quality in the previous period, lagged firm size and year fixed effects based 
on Equation (1). A positive coefficient indicates that job reallocation shifts the structure of employment towards better firms and is growth-
enhancing. Coefficients are normalised with respect to the global standard deviation in firm quality. Firms are ranked based on the moving 
average in wages and productivity over the previous three years. As an example, an increase of 1% in average firm wages is associated with 
an increase in firm-level employment growth of workers aged 15-24 of 0.1 percentage points. For more details, see Box 5.3. Unweighted average

Ageing is associated with a slowdown of growth-enhancing job reallocation 
Next, the impact of demographic change on the evolution of between-firm wage and productivity growth 
between 2001 and 2019 is analysed. This is done using a shift-share decomposition on changes in 
between-firm wage and productivity growth within and across age groups (Box 5.7).17 The shift-share 
analysis accounts for the effects of demographic change through its impact on the age structure of 
employment (changes in age-specific employment shares), as well as changes in the mobility behaviour 
of older workers relative to younger workers in response to, for example, changes in retirement age or life 
expectancy (age-specific shifts in growth-enhancing reallocation). Figure 5.10 shows that in some 
countries between-firm growth rates due to job mobility to better firms have become somewhat more 
important for older workers relative to younger ones. 
Box 5.7. Methodology IV: The role of ageing in the evolution of aggregate growth 
The role of workforce ageing in the evolution of between-firm wage and productivity growth (∆𝑦𝑡) is 
analysed using a shift-share decomposition. The share component captures changes in between-firm 
growth due to changes in the age structure of employment – which, in turn, arise from changes in 
age-specific employment rates and population shares (composition). The shift component instead 
measures the change in between-firm growth rates within age groups due to changes in age-specific 
mobility behaviour (growth rates). Formally, this can be written as: 
(4) ∆𝑦𝑡=
∑𝑦̅𝑎
𝑎
∆𝑠𝑡,𝑎
⏟      
𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 (𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)
+
∑𝑠̅𝑎
𝑎
∆𝑦𝑡,𝑎
⏟      
𝑆ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡 (𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠)
 
where ∆𝑠𝑡,𝑎 measures the change in the share of employment of age group 𝑎 between time 𝑡 and 𝑡−1 
and ∆𝑦𝑡,𝑎 measures the change in between-firm wage or productivity growth rates of age group 𝑎 between 
time 𝑡 and 𝑡−1 due to age-specific shifts in growth-enhancing job reallocation. The average employment 
share of age group 𝑎 over the entire period is given by 𝑠̅𝑎 and the average growth between-firm wage or 
productivity growth rate of age group 𝑎 due to growth-enhancing job reallocation is given by 𝑦̅𝑎. 
The shift component in turn can be decomposed as the sum of an average shift component related to 
general changes in labour market dynamism that affect all age groups equally, and of a differential shift 
component that differs across age groups. One factor that may give rise to differential changes in 
between-firm growth due to growth-enhancing job reallocation across age groups may be ageing as 
longer working lives may change the incentives for job mobility to better firms disproportionately among 
older workers. Formally, the decomposition can therefore be extended as follows: 
(5) ∆𝑦𝑡=
∑𝑦̅𝑎
𝑎
∆𝑠𝑡,𝑎
⏟      
𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 (𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)
+ ∑𝑠̅𝑎
𝑎
(∆𝑦𝑡,𝑎−∆𝑦̅𝑡)
⏟            
𝐷𝑖𝑓.𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡 (𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠)
+ ∆𝑦̅𝑡 
where ∆𝑦̅𝑡 measures the common shift component. For the present purposes, the differential shift 
component is entirely attributed ageing. The total effect of ageing on changes in between-firm growth 
rates is then given by the sum of the share component and the differential shift component. Note that, 
even though this chapter only considers the sum of these two components as the role of ageing, it 
might increase mobility and growth-enhancing reallocation at any age – for youth, who will be in short 
supply, and for the old, who will have longer time working lives. The common shift component might 
therefore also contain some effect of ageing among many other factors.

Demographic developments have tended to weaken growth-enhancing job reallocation (Figure 5.11). More 
specifically, demographic change is associated with slower wage and productivity growth due to 
reallocation by respectively 0.13 and 0.10 percentage points between 2001 and 2019, which represents a 
considerable part of the average annual aggregate growth rate of, respectively, 0.6 and 1.0% among the 
set of countries considered. This is driven by the change in the age structure of employment towards older 
workers and the lower responsiveness of their mobility choices to between-firm differences in pay or 
productivity. The shift of the structure of employment to older workers mainly reflects the impact of 
workforce ageing, but to a lesser extent also declining employment rates among youth due to the long-
term reduction in fertility and the tendency of youth to study longer (see Annex Figure 5.A.5). The adverse 
effects of changes in the age composition of employment are partially offset by differential trends in 
age-specific growth rates due to job reallocation.18,19

the early 2000s to late 2010s that are accounted for by workforce ageing in a shift-share decomposition on the evolution of age-composition of

From a policy perspective, a key question is why workforce ageing tends to slow aggregate wage and 
productivity growth. If this reflects a lower responsiveness of firm-level employment growth to differences 
in firm quality among older workers, this raises concerns about the adaptability of the workforce to structural 
change and there may be a case for developing policies that can support job mobility among such workers. 
For example, the structure of older-worker employment across firms may be less sensitive to differences 
in firm quality because older workers face more important constraints to changing employers (e.g. home 
ownership, job security, social ties, family responsibilities), because adjusting employment levels of older 
workers is more costly for employers, or because high quality employers prefer to hire younger workers 
(see Chapter 3 for a discussion of hiring discrimination against older workers). By contrast, if workforce 
ageing slows aggregate wage and productivity because older workers feel that they have little to gain from 
changing employers either because they have already climbed the job ladder, or because they have fewer 
working years remaining in their careers, this would require policies to increase the returns to mobility at 
older ages via training and career guidance. 
The segregation of employment by age across firms of different quality has tended to 
deepen slightly over time 
An interesting question is the extent to which workforce ageing affects the careers of younger workers and 
their contribution to efficiency-enhancing job reallocation. To the extent that older workers are concentrated 
in better firms and older workers continue to work longer, this may dampen opportunities for younger 
workers for moving up the firm job ladder. For the most recent year, older workers aged 55-74 account for 
17% of employment in the bottom quintile of the employment-weighted firm distribution of wages and 19% 
of employment in the top quintile (Figure 5.12). However, young workers aged 15-34 account for 43% of 
employment in the bottom quintile and 27% in the top quintile. This age-based employment segregation 
has increased slightly since the early 2000s and reflects the importance of the job ladder for integrating 
new cohorts of young workers in the labour market. The empirical literature does not appear to have directly 
addressed the growing segregation of employment by age across firms nor the impact of workforce ageing 
on the opportunities of younger workers for upward mobility between firms. Recent evidence instead has 
focused on the effects of delayed retirement on the employment opportunities of young workers within 
firms,20 while earlier research clearly dismissed the idea that older workers crowd out younger ones in 
employment at the aggregate level (the “lump-of-labour fallacy”, i.e. the incorrect premise that there is a 
fixed quantity of aggregate employment).

5.3. Policy implications 
Policies have a key role to play in supporting growth-enhancing job reallocation by promoting flexibility for 
firms and supporting job mobility between firms for workers. Special emphasis is placed in policies that 
can promote job mobility among mid-career and older workers. 
5.3.1. Policies that provide flexibility to firms 
The OECD has consistently emphasised the importance of flexibility for firms for well-functioning labour 
markets, including the process of efficiency-enhancing job reallocation. However, flexibility can take 
different forms, and some forms of flexibility are better than others (OECD, 2018[39]). This sub-section 
focuses on the role of employment protection and job retention schemes for efficiency-enhancing job 
reallocation. 
Employment flexibility is important for efficiency-enhancing job reallocation 
Job security provisions, whether in the form of employment protection or job retention schemes, can have 
important implications for broadly shared productivity growth. They can contribute to stronger productivity 
growth by strengthening incentives for the accumulation and preservation of firm-specific human capital in 
the workplace by promoting long-term employer-employee relationships (Belot, Boone and Van Ours, 
2007[40]) and the use of high-performance work and management practices (Bloom and Van Reenen, 
2010[41]). However, they can also undermine productivity growth. For example, by reducing the tendency 
of firms to adjust employment in line with changing business conditions and weakening the incentives of

workers to move to more productive firms, they may undermine efficiency-enhancing job reallocation 
across firms. 
The literature suggests that overly strict employment protection against the dismissal of workers on open-
ended contracts reduces efficiency-enhancing job reallocation. In particular, overly strict employment 
protection legislation can slow job reallocation by reducing vacancy creation and hence opportunities for 
job mobility (Bassanini, Nunziata and Venn, 2009[42]; Andrews and Cingano, 2014[43]; Bartelsman, 
Haltiwanger and Scarpetta, 2013[44]).21 The challenge for policy makers is therefore to provide sufficient 
employment flexibility to firms to allow jobs being reallocated to their most productive uses, while providing 
incentives for learning and innovation in the workplace and protecting workers against abuse, for which 
employment protection legislation remains essential. 
If not well designed, employment flexibility can increase turnover without supporting growth-
enhancing job reallocation 
Net job mobility only represents a small fraction of gross worker mobility as worker flows often take place 
between similar firms or offset each other. In fact, net job flows that shift the structure of employment 
between quintiles of the firm-quality distribution only account for about 5% of gross worker mobility in the 
linked employer-employee data used in this Chapter.22 While this share increases when segmenting the 
firm-quality distribution more finely, the qualitative pattern remains unchanged.23 This suggests that gross 
worker flows are predominantly driven by factors unrelated to differences in firm wages, including personal 
considerations, but also policies and institutions. 
One factor that may contribute to gross worker mobility rates, but not growth-enhancing job reallocation, 
is a strong reliance on overly flexible work arrangements, including short-duration fixed-term contracts. 
While a moderate use of temporary work can help to provide additional job opportunities to unemployed 
workers by enhancing the matching process between firms and workers, an excessive use comes at the 
expense of permanent contracts and results in low opportunities for contract conversion and high job 
turnover (OECD, 2018[39]). In some countries with an excessive reliance on temporary work, this results 
in part from a strict protection of open-ended contracts which creates incentives for the use of flexible 
work arrangements, resulting in labour market duality (Hijzen, Mondauto and Scarpetta, 2017[45]; 
Bassanini and Garnero, 2013[46]; OECD, 2018[39]). To avoid providing incentives for an excessive use of 
temporary work, employment protection should remain moderate, be balanced across contract types 
and effectively protect workers against unfair dismissal, including dismissal based on age discrimination 
– see Chapter 3. 
Another factor affecting the relationship between worker mobility and reallocation relates to the role played 
by unemployment insurance and job retention schemes during deep economic crises (Giupponi, Landais 
and Lapeyre, 2022[47]). To the extent that economic crises represent episodes of creative destruction during 
which jobs in low quality firms are destroyed followed by the creation of jobs in high quality firms in the 
recovery, no attempt should be made to preserve worker-firm matches that are under pressure and support 
should focus on providing income and job-search support to unemployed workers. However, to the extent 
that economic crises only temporarily put worker-firm matches at risk that remain viable in the medium 
term, there is a case for policies that promote labour hoarding, including job retention schemes.24 The 
optimal response is likely to vary depending on the nature of the crisis and a country’s policies and 
institutions. Evaluations of job retention schemes in European countries during the COVID-19 crisis tend 
to suggest that their negative impact on growth-enhancing job reallocation was limited (Calligaris et al., 
2023[48]). 
5.3.2. Policies that support mobility of workers to better firms 
The analysis in this chapter demonstrates that, while employment flexibility for firms is important for growth-
enhancing job reallocation, barriers to the mobility of workers may be even more important. Consequently,

more attention should be given to addressing barriers to job mobility and strengthening incentives for job 
mobility. This sub-section focuses on policy barriers to job-to-job mobility in the form of occupational 
licencing and non-compete agreements, and the role of wage-setting policies in shaping incentives for it 
(see Chapter 3 for additional discussion in relation to older mid-career and older workers). 
Professional licensing regulations are under increased scrutiny amid growing concerns 
about their consequences for growing-enhancing job reallocation 
Licensed or regulated professions must follow rules on entry and conduct in their field. Licensing 
regulations may include administrative procedures, qualification requirements and mobility restrictions (von 
Rueden and Bambalaite, 2020[49]; OECD, 2022[4]). As credence goods, the quality of professional services 
is difficult for consumers to assess. Professional licencing aims to correct market failures caused by 
information asymmetries between consumers and service providers. However, by creating entry barriers, 
licensing regulations can curtail competition, restrict business dynamism and slow growth-enhancing job 
reallocation. 
The share of professions subject to licensing regulations is significant and has expanded over time, 
covering up to 30% of jobs in some countries. While their use was traditionally limited to liberal professions 
like lawyers and engineers, it has tended to expand to include occupations, such as dockers, driving school 
instructors, transporters, and hairdressers (Bambalaite, Nicoletti and von Rueden, 2020[50]; Kleiner and 
Krueger, 2010[51]). Evidence on their broader economic consequences is limited. There is some indication 
that licensing slows firm-level productivity growth, harms entry of innovative firms and lowers employment 
growth in the most productive ones (Bambalaite, Nicoletti and von Rueden, 2020[50]). For example, in the 
United States, separation and hiring rates tend to be lower in states with a higher share of occupations 
under professional licensing regulations and job mobility across states is generally lower towards states 
with more stringent licensing requirements (Hermansen, 2019[52]). Licensing may also curtail employment 
growth and reduce earnings in occupations with similar skill-profiles (Dodini, 2023[53]). 
Amid growing concerns over the unintended consequences of professional licensing regulations in a 
context of weak productivity growth, the design and implementation of such regulations is receiving 
increased scrutiny from policy makers. While they remain crucial in reducing information asymmetries, 
care should be taken that they do not unwittingly create barriers to growth-enhancing job mobility and 
remain pertinent as technological developments are rapidly changing the delivery of professional services 
(OECD, 2023[54]). To limit unintended consequences, policy makers should weigh the use of compulsory 
licensing measures against voluntary certification approaches that can be combined with consumer 
information systems (e.g. service quality comparison platforms) (OECD, 2022[4]). Shifting the emphasis 
from input quality (ensuring professional service providers possess adequate qualifications) to output 
quality (ensuring the services provided meet certain minimum standards) may also have more limited 
negative side effects on competition and job reallocation (OECD, 2018[55]). 
There is growing evidence that non-compete and other restraint clauses are not just used to 
protect legitimate business interests but also to limit competition. 
Non-compete and related restrictive clauses are contractual provisions that limit employees’ activities after 
they leave their current job. Such clauses can prevent former employees from working for a competitor, 
starting a competing business, or competing firms from hiring each other’s employees (“poaching”). In 
most OECD countries, these restraints are permitted and governed by law to safeguard legitimate 
employer interests, such as trade secrets, client information or specific investment in the employment 
relationship (e.g. training) (Andrews and Garnero, 2025[56]). However, these clauses can also be used to 
reduce competition in product and labour markets, potentially hindering growth-enhancing job reallocation.

Surveys from selected countries indicate that the prevalence of non-compete clauses is high, potentially 
covering up to a quarter of the workforce and used by as many as half of firms, with usage possibly on the 
rise (Andrews and Garnero, 2025[56]; OECD, 2022[4]; OECD, 2019[57]). While non-competes are especially 
common in knowledge-intensive fields, protecting legitimate business concerns, they are increasingly 
found in sectors where access to proprietary information and trade secrets is highly unlikely, such as 
among entry-level fast-food workers in the United States (Andrews and Garnero, 2025[56]). Non-compete 
clauses are often packaged with other restraint clauses that directly impede worker mobility, including non-
disclosure, non-solicitation, and non-recruitment agreements. Where the use of non-competes is formally 
limited, they can also be substituted with clauses that do not explicitly restrict worker mobility but effectively 
serve as functional equivalent. 
Importantly, non-compete clauses can stifle job mobility, growth-enhancing job reallocation and technology 
diffusion. As such, they may have contributed to the slowing of productivity growth and the decline in the 
labour share (Buckley, Rankin and Andrews, 2024[58]; FTC, 2024[59]). For example, non-compete clauses 
have negatively impacted competitive labour market conditions in the United States by hindering efficient 
matching between workers and employers, as well as in product and service markets by inhibiting new 
business formation and innovation (FTC, 2024[59]).25 The 2024 Draghi report on EU competitiveness 
echoes these concerns, recommending that competition policy address practices that limit labour mobility 
between companies, including non-compete agreements (Draghi, 2024[2]). Recent evidence from Austria 
on the introduction of a ban on non-competes for low-wage workers in 2006, suggests that the ban of non-
competes had only a modest positive impact on overall job mobility, somewhat in contrast with the evidence 
for the United States, although several context-specific factors can explain the result (see Box 5.8). 
Given the growing concerns about the excessive use of non-compete clauses and their consequences, 
there are multiple options to restrict their use, many of which are already in place in several 
OECD countries, e.g. Andrews and Garnero (2025[56]) and OECD (2022[4]; 2019[57]). These measures 
include, among others, complete bans, partial bans targeting low-wage workers or those on fixed-term 
contracts, limitations on their application in terms of time or geographic scope or requirements related to 
compensation and notification. Additionally, competition authorities in some countries have also acted 
against other restraint clauses (e.g. a ban on non-solicitation clauses). Nevertheless, the evidence 
suggests that regulations limiting the enforceability of non-compete clauses may not suffice to prevent their 
unlawful use in the absence of significant penalties for their abuse by employers (Starr, Prescott and 
Bishara, 2020[60]; Boeri, Garnero and Luisetto, 2024[61]).

Box 5.8. The economic effects of restrictions on non-compete agreements and the role of policy 
design: The case of Austria 
Evidence for the United States suggests that non-compete agreements can have large negative effects 
on job mobility, wages and innovation – see Starr (2024[62]) for an overall review. However, empirical 
evidence outside of the United States is scarce (Andrews and Garnero, 2025[63]). A study of a 2006 
reform in Austria which banned non-compete clauses for low-wage workers finds a modest negative 
effect of non-compete clauses on job mobility, and no effect on earnings growth (Young, 2024[64]). 
Beyond the inherent differences in their labour markets, several design factors may play a role in 
explaining the differing effects of non-compete regulations in Austria and the United States. 
• 
First, non-compete clauses are not the only post-employment restraint that matters. While the 
2006 reform in Austria restricted the use of non-compete agreements, it also expanded the use 
of training repayment clauses, allowing firms to recover training costs from up to five years 
before a worker’s departure (previously three years). While training repayment clauses do not 
directly restrict worker mobility, they add costs to workers who may want to leave (Harris, 
2021[65]). Considering all the clauses that may limit workers’ mobility (e.g. non-recruitment/non-
solicitation of colleagues, non-solicitation of clients, repayment of training costs or repayment 
of benefits) is therefore key to ensure that limitations to the use of non-compete clauses do not 
simply translate into a higher use or higher enforcement of other clauses. 
• 
Second, lack of clarity about the applicability of non-compete agreements hinders the effect of 
reforms aimed at reducing their use. The Austrian reform introduced a threshold below which 
non-competes are not enforceable. The threshold changes every year and only certain wage 
components are included in its definition. Moreover, what matters in the case of Austria is not 
the wage at the moment of signing the contract but the wage at the end of the employment 
relationship. This may result in considerable uncertainty by the workers concerned about the 
actual enforceability of non-compete agreements hindering the intended effects of the reform. 
• 
Third, even unenforceable clauses can stifle job mobility. Banning or restricting non-compete 
agreements is not enough if they are still used in employment contracts. Research for the 
United States and Italy shows that even unenforceable non-compete agreements can have a 
chilling effect on worker mobility, as workers often do not realise that they are unenforceable 
and cite them as a reason for not taking a job offer from a competitor (Starr, Prescott and 
Bishara, 2020[60]; Prescott and Starr, 2024[66]; Boeri, Garnero and Luisetto, 2024[61]). Since the 
use of non-compete agreements in Austria was made merely non-enforceable among workers 
with incomes below the threshold but applicable to workers whose incomes increase beyond 
the threshold, employers in Austria have a clear incentive to include “dormant” non-compete 
agreements that become enforceable in case the threshold is passed. However, and as 
discussed above, workers may think that they are enforceable even if they fall below the 
threshold. 
Another reform in 2015 in Austria, which, differently from the 2006 reform, was done in agreement with 
social partners, significantly increased the threshold and clarified the wage components to be taken 
into account. The reform also brought back the time period for repayment to three years. The effects of 
the 2015 reform have not yet been evaluated and hence it is not clear how effective it has been in 
restricting the use of non-compete agreements and promoting job mobility.

A better understanding of the role of wage-setting institutions for efficiency-enhancing 
reallocation is needed 
The role of wage-setting institutions, such as minimum wages and collective bargaining, in efficiency-
enhancing job reallocation remains a topic of debate. While potentially suppressing incentives for job 
mobility, minimum wages may ensure fairer wages for workers with a vulnerable bargaining position in 
labour markets where employers have significant wage-setting power, and therefore enhance rather than 
impede efficient labour allocation and worker mobility (Manning, 2020[67]). Descriptive evidence suggests 
that a stronger compression of wages is not associated with growth-enhancing reallocation (Figure 5.13). 
When measuring growth-enhancing reallocation in terms of average wages, there is no significant 
relationship between the responsiveness of net employment to wages, through either job-to-job or 
employment mobility, and wage compression across countries, as measured by the ratio of dispersion in 
firm-level productivity to dispersion in firm-level wages. 
Figure 5.13. Wage compression does not have major effects on growth-enhancing job reallocation 
Wage compression and growth-enhancing reallocation among incumbent firms as measured by the employment-
weighted impact of firm-quality on net employment growth across firms, net job-to-job mobility and net employment 
mobility 
 
Note: Job-to-job mobility: responsiveness of net job-to-job mobility to firm quality. Employment mobility: responsiveness of net employment 
mobility to firm quality. Wage compression: dispersion of wages over the dispersion in productivity between firms (lower scores represent 
stronger compression). The figure shows the relationship of wage compression and the responsiveness of employment growth on log firm wages 
in the previous period (controlling for lagged firm size and year times industry fixed effects), following Decker et al. (2020[14]). Positive 
responsiveness indicates that job reallocation shifts the structure of employment towards higher-paying firms and contributes to aggregate wage 
growth. For more details, see Box 5.3.

The ambiguous effects of wage floors for growth-enhancing job reallocation could be the result of two 
competing mechanisms. By compressing the wage distribution between firms and reducing incentives for 
voluntary job mobility, wage floors may weaken the job ladder and reduce net job-to-job mobility, making 
it more difficult for highly productive firms to attract workers (OECD, 2018[39]). For example, Hijzen, 
Lillehagen and Zwysen (2024[27]) show that higher wage compression in Norway leads to a weaker job 
ladder as compared to the United States, even though the overall pace of growth-enhancing reallocation 
is similar in both countries.26 At the same time, wage floors can force the least productive firms to reduce 
employment or exit the market (Aaronson et al., 2018[68]; Chava, Oettl and Singh, 2023[69]). If workers from

exiting firms find jobs in more productive ones, overall employment may remain unaffected while aggregate 
productivity increases. Recent evidence from Germany (Dustmann et al., 2022[70]) and the United States 
(Rao and Risch, 2024[71]) confirms the importance of this firm-driven process of efficiency-enhancing job 
reallocation. These effects are more pronounced when less productive firms that employ a relatively large 
share of minimum-wage workers experience greater declines in profitability, employment, and survival, 
while more productive firms expand employment (Dube and Lindner, 2024[72]). 
To promote productivity growth through job reallocation, wage-setting institutions that limit wage dispersion 
should be complemented with policies that enhance voluntary job mobility and foster innovation in low-
productivity firms. The consequences of wage floors for growth-enhancing reallocation depend crucially on 
the extent to which they shift job opportunities for workers from less to more productive firms and the ability 
and willingness of workers to move to more productive firms. The former is likely to require flexible product 
and labour markets while the latter can be supported through comprehensive activation policies and career 
guidance services. To promote worker-driven job mobility between firms, activation and career guidance 
services should also be made available to workers who are stuck in low-quality jobs and would like to make 
a career change. In addition, pay transparency measures might incentivise worker driven-job mobility by 
making the benefits of potential transitions more salient (see Box 5.9). 
Box 5.9. The role of pay transparency measures in growth-enhancing job reallocation 
Pay transparency measures mandate wage posting in job ads or making firm-level statistics on 
median/average pay by occupation public, often also by gender OECD (2021[73])). Such measures may 
not only help to promote gender equality at work but also may enhance growth-enhancing job-to-job 
mobility by making outside options with wage gains more salient to workers. This type of transparency 
could complement wage floors that compress wage differences by making remaining differences more 
visible. 
Workers often face substantial information barriers when assessing external opportunities. Most 
notably, workers tend to anchor their expectations about potential earnings elsewhere on their current 
wages, leading to systematic underestimation of the potential wage gains of outside job opportunities, 
particularly among lower-paid workers who tend to underestimate the potential wage gains of outside 
job opportunities (Cullen, 2024[74]; Jäger et al., 2024[75]). Mandated wage posting in job ads and public 
wage statistics may be able to correct these misconceptions. 
Recent evidence on mandating public disclosure of median employee pay in the United States shows 
that employees are more likely to depart firms introducing the disclosure of median employee pay. This 
suggests that pay transparency can increase job mobility by facilitating pay comparisons both within 
and across firms, with companies experiencing higher employee churn (Dambra et al., 2025[76]). 
Similarly, when the Slovak Republic mandated salary information in job postings, workers applied to a 
more diverse range of positions across sectors, and those hired after implementation earned 
approximately 3% higher wages than pre-reform hires (Skoda, 2022[77])). Similar effects were observed 
in Denmark, where information about external job offers flowing through networks facilitated transitions 
to higher-paying positions (Caldwell and Harmon, 2019[78]). 
With the EU Pay Transparency Directive, companies in EU countries are required to inform job seekers 
about starting salary or pay range of advertised positions by 2026. Several US states – notably 
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island and Washington – have introduced similar 
requirements in recent years (OECD, 2023[79]).

5.3.3. Policies directed at securing and supporting the mobility of mid-career and older 
workers 
Workforce ageing tends to reduce the contribution of growth-enhancing job reallocation to aggregate wage 
and productivity growth. To some extent, this might reflect the fact that older workers have already 
progressed up the job ladder to better firms and contributed to growth-enhancing job reallocation. However, 
some older workers may face specific barriers to job mobility that keep them locked in low-quality firms or 
undermine their job-finding prospects following job displacement. Addressing these barriers requires 
effective policy interventions that tackle barriers to job mobility among mid-career and older workers. 
Securing transitions of mid-career and older displaced workers through targeted support 
The consequences of job loss tend to be particularly severe for mid-career and older workers. For instance, 
workers aged 46- 50 lose about half of their annual pre-displacement earnings on average over the first 
5 years following job loss, while workers aged 18 to 20 only lose about 20% on average (OECD, 2024[3]). 
Older workers face larger earnings losses in part because they are more likely to exit the labour force 
permanently following job loss, reducing effective labour supply and potentially undermining economic 
growth and the sustainability of public finances. 
The risk of older workers leaving the labour force following job loss can be mitigated amongst others by 
early intervention measures targeted at workers at risk of dismissal or those who have been given notice 
of dismissal, as well as measures to adapt to structural transformation. For example, in Germany, the 
Qualifizierungsgeld allows for training and adaptation towards new roles within the same firm to support 
those who are affected by strong transformation pressures, while “basic support” for continuing vocational 
education and training (with subsidies depending on company size) is also available. Irrespective of 
transformation pressures, there is support for vocational education and training for those who have been 
given notice of dismissal. Further, Transfergesellschaften, which are part of a social plan during mass 
layoff, can temporarily employ displaced workers while offering support in finding new jobs and 
opportunities for skill development. Such programmes are particularly beneficial for workers who face a 
higher risk of long-term unemployment, many of whom are older workers (Fackler, Stegmaier and Upward, 
2024[80]). 
While labour force exits explain a part of the earnings losses among mid-career and older workers, they 
also tend to experience a decline in job quality when returning back to work. For example, mid-career and 
older workers aged 46-50 experience a 28% decline in wages relative to their job before displacement 
compared with practically zero average wage losses for workers aged 18 to 30 (OECD, 2024[3]). By 
providing an in-work benefit partially covering the difference in a worker’s current and pre-displacement 
wages, wage insurance can be a particularly useful instrument to mitigate wage losses among older 
workers following job loss. Importantly, this not only mitigates wage losses, but also tends to speed up the 
return to work by strengthening incentives for job search and lowering reservation wages. 
So far, wage insurance has been primarily targeted at older workers OECD (2024[31]), for example through 
the Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) programme for trade-displaced older workers in 
the United States. Evidence on this programme suggests that wage insurance significantly accelerated 
re-employment and resulted in higher long-run cumulative earnings (Hyman, Kovak and Leive, 2024[81]). 
The reduction in unemployment duration was sizeable, and as a result, the costs of the programme were 
largely offset by reduced expenditures on unemployment insurance and increased tax revenues. There is 
no evidence that wage insurance led to lower re-employment wages or a faster wage progression up the 
job ladder upon re-employment. This may, to some extent, reflect the programme’s focus on older workers.

A wider availability of employment services can support mobility of employed workers 
Employment services should be available for mid-career and older workers who have been displaced as 
well as those who have become stuck in low-quality jobs. Job-search assistance and career guidance can 
be particularly important for older workers who do not have recent experience with job mobility (OECD, 
2024[3]). While public employment services traditionally focus on the unemployed, expanding these 
services to include employed job seekers, particularly those in dead-end jobs, could help prevent 
involuntary job losses and early labour market exit. For example, Switzerland’s Viamia programme offers 
free career guidance to employed workers aged 40 and over, helping them identify development 
opportunities and supporting job transitions (OECD, 2024[3]). 
Career guidance in the form of career counselling and coaching might help older workers fill knowledge 
gaps and gaining the confidence needed for successful job search. In the Netherlands, the Programme for 
Sustainable Employability and Early Retirement (MDIEU) provides subsidies to employers and sectors to 
offer career counselling and coaching specifically designed for older job seekers. 
Building professional networks is another critical challenge, with many older workers reporting they needed 
help finding contacts to “break into” desired jobs (OECD, 2024[3]). Local and national governments can 
strengthen the access to professional and social networks by creating public spaces that facilitate network 
building, such as group career counselling sessions specifically, designed for older workers. PES can also 
assist older workers in growing their networks and fostering intergenerational knowledge transfers through 
networking events and mentoring programmes. 
Removing barriers that disincentivise job and geographic mobility 
While direct interventions and employment services play a vital role in supporting job mobility, mid-career 
and older workers may also face other barriers, beyond the realm of the public employment services, that 
undermine job transitions. 
Mid-career and older workers may hesitate to leave long-held positions due to the risk of losing 
accumulated severance entitlements and other tenure-related benefits. An increased portability of social 
benefits and severance pay entitlements could boost job mobility among mid-career and older workers. 
For example, in 2003, Austria replaced tenure-based severance pay by portable savings accounts funded 
through employer contributions, which workers can access in the case of job loss or transfer when directly 
moving to another job and convert in a pension at retirement. There is some evidence that this increased 
job mobility, especially among workers distressed firms (Kettemann, Kramarz and Zweimüller, 2017[82]). A 
sensible cap on severance entitlements for long tenures may also be an option. 
Geographic constraints may create additional obstacles, especially for mid-career and older workers who 
are more likely to be homeowners. For example, overly restrictive housing policies can make relocation 
difficult, even when better opportunities exist elsewhere. Housing policy reforms could boost mobility, for 
example by lowering property transaction taxes, and easing overly strict rental regulations (Causa, 
Abendschein and Cavalleri, 2021[83]; Causa and Pichelmann, 2020[84]). Making housing assistance and 
access to social housing portable could also help some workers relocate more easily, particularly those on 
lower incomes. For example, the removal of queuing or residency requirements, such as the Right to Move 
in English housing associations, may increase job and geographic mobility (OECD, 2020[85]). While such 
approaches can benefit workers of all ages that want to relocate for a job, mid-career and older workers 
may often have stronger preferences for geographic stability and might benefit more from approaches that 
support local career transitions. 
Training and work experience are necessary to keep up with changing labour markets 
A changing world of work, with rapid advances in artificial intelligence and other technologies, makes 
continuous skill development crucial for maintaining high-quality employment at older ages. However, skill

obsolescence poses a particular challenge for older workers, who are often less likely to participate in 
training and whose skills may therefore become obsolete as the skill demand on the labour market changes 
– see Chapter 4. This is in part related to fewer opportunities for training at older ages, and in part due to 
worries over whether acquiring new skills will lead to better outcomes (OECD, 2024[3]). 
To foster continued learning and upskilling at older ages, governments can implement targeted training 
initiatives that help older workers leverage their existing skills while developing new competencies – see 
Chapter 4 for a more extensive discussion. For example, Australia’s Career Transition Assistance Program 
provides tailored support for workers aged 45 and over, focussing on improving digital literacy and 
identifying transferable skills. The programme includes skills assessments and the development of career 
plans, helping participants to navigate transitions into new jobs. However, the success of such approaches 
often hinges on financial barriers. Latvia targets low-qualified older workers by covering 90-95% of training 
costs through the Improvement of Professional Competencies of Employed Person Program. This has 
increased training participation among workers who might otherwise be unable to afford such upskilling 
programmes (OECD, 2024[3]). Employers also play an important role in identifying relevant training 
initiatives. For example, Finland’s competence-based qualification system for adults in vocational training 
allows individuals to focus on areas where they need development without attending entire training 
programmes, with such areas for development assessed by committees of educational institutions and 
representatives of industry employers. 
Work experience programmes can also be important for fostering transitions for mid-career and older 
workers – see also Chapter 4. For example, in partnership with local employers, the United Kingdom’s 
Returnership Initiative offers training programmes (Skills Bootcamps), apprenticeships as well as 
pre-employment training and work-experience programmes (Sector-based Work Academy Programmes). 
These approaches allow workers to gain experience in different sectors before committing to enter new 
occupations and/or industries, while simultaneously helping employers address skills shortages (OECD, 
2024[3]). 
Recognition of prior learning (RPL) programmes is another important tool for supporting mobility among 
experienced workers. These programmes can shorten the duration of training by acknowledging existing 
competencies – e.g. those acquired on the job or outside of formal education – making upskilling more 
attractive for older workers who may be hesitant to invest in lengthy training programmes – see also 
Chapter 4. Several European countries have implemented RPL frameworks – for instance, the Dutch 
Ervaringscertificaat and the French Validation des Acquis de l’Expérience can formally recognise skills 
acquired through work experience. This can, for example, ensure that access to higher education can be 
granted without the necessary formal qualifications (OECD, 2024[3]). 
5.4. Concluding remarks 
This chapter has provided new insights into how growth-enhancing job reallocation contributes to 
aggregate wage and productivity growth in the context of workforce ageing using linked employer-
employee data from 17 OECD countries. It provides two key insights. First, the “job ladder”, i.e. job-to-job 
mobility to better firms, plays a key role in growth-enhancing job reallocation and hence aggregate wage 
and productivity growth. Second, workforce ageing tends to slow growth-enhancing job reallocation and 
may further result in weaker aggregate wage and productivity growth. Each of these findings has important 
implications for policies. 
The importance of the job ladder in efficiency-enhancing job reallocation implies that policies that provide 
flexibility for firms need to be combined with policies that can facilitate job mobility for workers. In the policy 
discussion on efficiency-enhancing job reallocation, there has traditionally been a strong emphasis on 
policies that can provide employment flexibility (e.g. employment protection, product market regulations). 
This is consistent with the competitive market paradigm, in which firms determine employment given wages

and workers are indifferent where they work, all else equal. However, if markets are imperfectly 
competitive, a more encompassing perspective on policies is needed. In an imperfectly competitive labour 
market, there are persistent wage gaps between firms, even for workers with the same skills, signalling 
the importance of frictions to job mobility and shaping the preferences of workers across different firms 
(OECD, 2022[4]). Consequently, there is a need to combine policies that provide employment flexibility for 
firms with policies that promote mobility for workers, including by addressing policy-related barriers to job 
mobility, such as professional licensing or the use of non-compete clauses, as well as policies that can 
help overcome barriers to job mobility between employers related to differences in skill requirements and 
location. 
Policies that can help to maintain a flexible workforce at all ages and support job mobility among mid-
career and older workers are particularly relevant. The chapter shows that since mid-career and older 
workers are less mobile, workforce ageing tends to slow growth-enhancing job reallocation, leading to 
lower aggregate wage and productivity growth. Whether lower mobility of mid-career and older workers is 
a result of larger costs of moving, for example because they face larger moving expenses (e.g. loss in job 
security, home ownership) or because they may have fewer working years to recover those implicit 
charges, or whether mid-career and older workers are already significantly better matched than younger 
workers and therefore have little to gain from job mobility, remains an open question. Irrespective of the 
origin of lower mobility among mid-career and older workers, policy has an important role to play in 
supporting job transitions of older workers to higher quality firms. Such policies should include employment 
and training services targeted at mid-career and older workers but also policies that reduce the costs of 
moving by making severance pay portable or reforming housing policies by reducing transaction taxes on 
selling and buying a home or relaxing overly strict rental regulations. There is also a role for increasing the 
returns to mobility at older ages via training and career guidance. 
It is worth pointing out that climbing the job ladder matters not just for growth-enhancing job reallocation, 
but also for the integration of workers in the labour market and the subsequent advancement in their 
careers. Indeed, the role of the job ladder for individual wage growth is much larger than that for aggregate 
wage and productivity growth. In fact, the effect of upward job-to-job mobility on aggregate growth is partly 
offset by the negative contribution of employment mobility related to the entry of young cohorts in low 
quality firms. If anything, the potential importance of climbing the job ladder for the integration of the 
workers in the labour market may be increasing as younger cohorts tend to start their careers in lower 
quality firms. Consequently, it is even more important to ensure that opportunities for climbing the job 
ladder are equally shared by preventing that one’s socio-economic background is a determinant of success 
in the labour market.

Annex Figure 5.A.2. Accounting for the role of mobility for cross-country differences in aggregate 
growth rates 
Share of the cross-country variances in growth rates in aggregate wages and productivity explained by the 
covariance of each mobility component (beta values) 
 
Note: Within-firm (stayers): average annual aggregate growth associated with workers staying in the same firm due to learning and innovation. 
Between-firm due to job reallocation: average annual between-firm growth due to net job reallocation across the employment-weighted quality 
distribution of firms. Job-to-job mobility: Between-firm due to job-to-job mobility: average annual between-firm growth due to net job-to-job 
mobility across the employment-weighted quality distribution of firms. Between-firm due to employment mobility: average annual between-firm 
growth due net employment mobility across the employment-weighted quality distribution of firms. The figure provides a decomposition of 
aggregate wage and productivity growth across countries as shown in Figure 5.9 based on “beta values” following Fujita and Ramey (2009[34]). 
“Beta values” are calculated by the covariance of within-firm growth and total growth across countries divided by the variance of total growth 
and the covariance of between-firm growth and total growth across countries divided by the variance of total growth. Firm-level average wages 
(17 countries): Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, 
New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Firm-level labour productivity (9 countries): Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.

Annex Figure 5.A.3. Time trends in responsiveness 
Age-specific between-firm aggregate wage and productivity growth rates, by age group, first vs. last year, 
percentage 
 
Note: First year: initial year of coverage for each country (typically 2001, but with variation). Last year: last year of coverage for each country 
(typically 2019, with little variation). The figure shows the age-specific between-firm aggregate wage and productivity growth rates based on 
Hahn, Hyatt and Janicki (2021[28]). For more details, see Box 5.4. The exercise is restricted to countries with sufficiently long and uninterrupted 
time series (2005-18, see Annex Table 5.A.3). Firm-level average wages (11 countries): Austria, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, 
Italy, Lithuania, New Zealand, Portugal and Sweden. Firm-level labour productivity (6 countries): Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Portugal and 
Sweden.

Annex Figure 5.A.4. Accounting for the role of dispersion and responsiveness for cross-country 
differences in aggregate growth rates 
Share of the cross-country variances in between-firm growth rates in aggregate wages and productivity explained by 
the covariance of dispersion in firm quality and responsiveness to firm quality (beta values) 
 
Note: Responsiveness: share of the cross-country variances in between-firm growth rates in aggregate wages and productivity explained by 
responsiveness of employment growth to firm quality. Dispersion: share of the cross-country variances in between-firm growth rates in aggregate 
wages and productivity explained by the dispersion to firm quality. The figure provides a decomposition of aggregate wage and productivity 
growth across countries as shown in Figure 5.9 based on “beta values” following Fujita and Ramey (2009[34]). “Beta values” are calculated by 
the covariance of between-firm growth related to responsiveness and total between-firm growth across countries divided by the variance of total 
between-firm growth and the covariance of between-firm growth related to dispersion and total between-firm growth across countries divided by 
the variance of total between-firm growth. Firm-level average wages (17 countries): Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, 
France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Firm-level labour productivity 
(9 countries): Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.

Notes
 
1 The analysis using linked employer-employee data is based on contributions by Eliana Viviano (Bank of 
Italy), Patrick Bennett (University of Liverpool and IZA), Cesar Barreto (OECD and FAU), Felipe Bento 
Caires (European University Institute), Lucas Chen (Reserve Bank of New Zealand), Jose Garcia-Louzao 
(Bank of Lithuania, Vilnius University and CESifo), Dogan Gülümser (Uppsala University), Salvatore 
Lattanzio (Bank of Italy and Bocconi University), Benjamin Lochner (FAU, IAB and IZA), Stefano Lombardi 
(VATT, IFAU, IZA and UCLS), Tahsin Mehdi (StatCan), Jordy Meekes (Leiden University and IZA), Balázs 
Muraközy (University of Liverpool), Marco G. Palladino (Banque de France), Kjell Salvanes (NHH and 
IZA), Oskar Nordström Skans (Uppsala University, UCLS, IZA and IFAU), Rune Vejlin (Aarhus University 
and IZA), and Wouter Zwysen (ETUI). This chapter is part of a broader OECD project that mobilises linked 
employer-employee data for cross-country research and policy analysis (LinkEED 2.0). For more details, 
please visit: www.oecd.org/en/about/projects/linkeed-200.html. 
2 This is to an important extent driven by large countries, including the United States. When taking the 
simple average across countries, there is no evidence of a decoupling between wage and productivity 
growth. 
3 This approach keeps age-specific mobility fixed in 2017 and assumes no change in this measure over 
time. However, it is likely that the mobility of older workers increases over time as careers become longer. 
For example, there is some indication that the contribution of job mobility to aggregate wage and

productivity growth among older workers has increased between the early 2000s and late 2010s (Annex 
Figure 5.A.3). 
4 Employment refers to private sector non-agricultural dependent employment. 
5 In contrast to the concept of job reallocation discussed in Section 5.2, efficiency-enhancing job 
reallocation takes account of both the amount of job reallocation and its direction. 
6 In perfectly competitive labour markets, firms are wage-takers and there is no link between wages and 
productivity across firms. In that case, wage differences between firms reflect “compensating differentials” 
for differences in non-wage working conditions. 
7 Since the model used for Figure 5.6 can only be estimated for incumbent firms, entering firms are 
excluded from the analysis. 
8 Gross worker mobility is extensive, with about 58% of workers hired or separating from their employer 
each year. On average, job-to-job mobility accounts for 53% of this gross worker mobility, while 
employment mobility accounts for 47%. 
9 As noted by Bertheau and Vejlin (2022[93]) annual data may overstate the relative importance of gross 
job-to-job mobility in overall gross worker mobility. It is not clear, a priori, how aggregation bias affects the 
role of net job-to-job mobility in efficiency-enhancing job reallocation. The role of net job-to-job mobility 
only captures the direction of job mobility across firms that differ in their wages and productivity and does 
not depend on the importance of gross worker flows. We find, using quarterly data for Austria for 2018 and 
2019, that it does not significantly alter the role of net job-to-job mobility in growth-enhancing job 
reallocation, i.e. its direction across the firm distribution in productivity and wages. 
10 Cohort effects can also play a role in explaining declining responsiveness of employment growth to firm 
quality. For example, more recent cohorts may be less mobile because they tend to be more skilled and 
more specialised, rendering the matching process between firms and workers more complex (Baksy, 
Caratelli and Engbom, 2024[30]). 
11 To some extent, this reflects the larger negative contribution of employment mobility in countries with 
low wage growth. 
12 “Beta values” are calculated by the covariance of within-firm growth and total growth across countries 
divided by the variance of total growth and the covariance of between-firm growth and total growth across 
countries divided by the variance of total growth. 
13 Based on quarterly data for the United States in Hahn, Hyatt and Janicki (2021[28]), on-the-job wage 
growth contributed about 0.3 percentage points to the average quarterly to earnings growth between 1996 
and 2017. The contribution of job-to-job mobility was about 0.4 percentage points and employment 
mobility -0.5 percentage points. 
14 All exercises in this section exclude evidence for Belgium, as the source data does not contain workers 
beyond the age of 69 and is therefore not comparable to data used for other countries in this chapter. 
15 Differences in the responsiveness of employment growth to firm quality by gender are negligible.

16 This is also reflected by a willingness of older workers to accept a decline in hourly wages in exchange 
for fewer working hours (Ameriks et al., 2020[86]). 
17 In practice, this exercise is restricted to countries with uninterrupted time-series between at least 2005 
and 2018. 
18 Under a strong assumption of unchanged trends in between-firm growth rates across age groups, 
projections on demographic developments between 2020 and 2060, following Fluchtmann, Keese and 
Adema (2024[19]) as well as UN (2024[20]) (not shown here), only marginally depress annual aggregate 
wage and productivity growth further. This is mainly a result of more muted projected changes in the age 
composition of employment over future decades. 
19 The common shift, which may also capture some effects of ageing, is positive. How much of this can be 
attributed to ageing itself is unclear. 
20 Boeri et al. (2022[91]), and Bianchi et al (2023[92]) find that delaying retirement reduces opportunities for 
younger workers in the same firm, while Carta et al. (2021[5]) find the opposite, possibly due to the benefits 
of age diversity for productivity (OECD, 2020[94]). Hernæs et al. (2023[87]), who find reduced demand for 
young workers through delayed retirement, also find a small positive effect on labor productivity in the short 
run. 
21 Recent evidence from Sweden on the role of employment protection for older workers demonstrates that 
overly strict employment protection can preserve jobs that firms would prefer to terminate as they are no 
longer sufficiently productive. While this affects a relatively small fraction of older workers, most of which 
remain sufficiently productive, it can lower firm productivity (Saez, Schoefer and Seim, 2023[88]). 
22 Gross worker mobility is somewhat over 50% as shown in Figure 5.5, while net job mobility is around 
2.5% on average across quintiles in Figure 5.6. This suggests that the share of net mobility in overall 
worker mobility is around 5%. 
23 The rate of excess job reallocation, based on job creation and destruction as defined in Section 5.1, 
accounts for about a third of gross worker mobility. However, this is an upper bound since not all changes 
in net firm employment contribute to changes in the firm quality distribution. 
24 Job retention schemes are not effective in dealing with structural shocks and indeed risk slowing job 
reallocation in response to permanent shocks. 
25 Johnson et al. (2024[89]) show that non-competes in the United States have potentially far-reaching 
consequences for labour market dynamics. However, they do not find important differences across age 
groups. 
26 Similarly, Forth et al. (2025[90]) find that the minimum wage tends to reduce job-to-job mobility in the 
United Kingdom. 
27 Due to methodological breaks affecting employment levels and productivity measures, data for France 
exclude the years 2008-09 and 2015-17.

Annex A. Statistical annex 
Sources and definitions 
The tables of the statistical annex show data for all 38 OECD countries where available. Data for Argentina, 
Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Peru, South Africa, OECD accession countries from the EU, Bulgaria, 
Croatia and Romania, as well as other non-OECD EU Member States are also compiled and included in 
a number of datasets. 
The standard tabulations (Tables A to R of former editions of the Employment Outlook) are replaced by 
web links pointing to data and indicators reported in the new OECD central data repository OECD Data 
Explorer, https://data-explorer.oecd.org/, which contains all data available. Some additional web links 
entitled Table S to W complete the statistical annex referring respectively to data and indicators on 
statutory minimum wages, trade union density, collective bargaining coverage and synthetic indicators of 
employment protection. A richer set of labour market data and indicators is accessible in the OECD Data 
Explorer. The metadata section of the online datasets reports definitions, notes and sources retained in 
national data sources. 
In general, Tables A to K report annual averages of monthly and quarterly estimates based on labour force 
surveys. Those shown for European countries in Tables A to C and G to K are mainly data from the 
European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), which are more comparable and sometime more consistent 
over time than national LFS results. Data for the remaining Tables L to V are from a combination of survey 
and administrative sources or national reporting for Table W. 
A broader set of data can be found in the OECD Employment Database (ED), https://www.oecd.org/
en/data/datasets/oecd-employment-database.html, which contains both raw data and indicators for longer 
time series and more detailed individual characteristics and type of main job such as data by age group, 
gender and employee job tenure, part time employment, involuntary part time employment, temporary 
employment, duration of unemployment. The data portal includes more data series than those shown in 
the web links of the Statistical Annex, such as, the distribution of employment by weekly usual hours 
worked intervals, potential labour force including so-called people marginally attached to the labour 
force, etc. The online database contains additional series on working time, earnings and features of 
institutional and regulatory environments of labour markets. Among these are the following: 
• 
Annual hours actually worked per person in employment for comparisons of trends over time 
• 
Employment by long usual weekly hours worked in the main job 
• 
Average gross annual wages per dependent employee in full time equivalent unit 
• 
Distribution of gross earnings of full-time employees by gender and earnings dispersion measures 
and wage gaps (between men and women and broad age groups) 
• 
Statutory minimum wages – levels and ratio of minimum to mean and median wages 
• 
Public expenditure on labour market programmes, number of beneficiaries and inflows into the 
labour market 
• 
Trade union density and collective bargaining coverage 
• 
Synthetic indicators of employment protection

Major breaks in series 
Tables A to K: Most of the breaks in series in the tables occurred for any of the following reasons: 
changes in survey design, survey questionnaire, survey frequency and administration, revisions of data 
series based on updated population census results. These changes may have affected the 
comparability over time of employment and/or unemployment levels and to a certain extent the ratios 
reported in the aforementioned tables: 
• 
Change in the measurement of the labour force status and methodology in the European 
Labour Force Survey since 2021: Data between 2020 and 2021 are affected by a break in 
series in Tables A-C and G-K. The size and direction of the breaks vary by country and statistics 
as 
reported 
in 
the 
national 
documentations 
on 
Eurostat 
website. 
See: 
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_Labour_Force_Survey_-
_new_methodology_from_2021_onwards. 
• 
Introduction of a continuous survey producing quarterly results: Austria (2003/04), Brazil 
(2011/12), France (2002/03), Germany (2004/05), Hungary (2005/06, monthly results), Iceland 
(2002/03), Italy (2003/04), Luxembourg (2002/03, quarterly results as of 2007) and Türkiye 
(2013/14). 
Data revisions in the following OECD countries: 
o 
2009 to 2015: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 
o 
Australia (since 2017), Denmark (2021), Italy (2018-20), Spain, Portugal and Sweden (since 
2021) and Poland (2015). 
o 
Chile: Re-estimation since 2010 implementing the quality estimation standards for 
household surveys set by the National Statistics Institute of Chile. 
• 
Redesign of labour force survey: Introduction of a new survey in Chile since April 2010 (see 
below), Germany (2010/11), Hungary (2002/03), Poland (2004/05), Portugal (2010/11) and 
Türkiye (2004/05 from quarterly to monthly results). Israel (2011/12), change from quarterly to 
monthly survey results and a change from “civilian” to “total” labour force (including those who 
are in compulsory or permanent military service). New Zealand (2015/16), the survey includes 
non-civilian personnel. Annual results for Colombia in 2020 are averaged over three-quarters 
(Q1, Q3 and Q4) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic outburst and suspension of the survey 
in the 2nd quarter. Since July 2020, a new edition of the continuous quarterly survey was 
re-introduced in Mexico (Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo, New edition ENOEN) after 
its suspension in April 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic outburst and lockdown 
measures. It was replaced in Q2 by a telephone interview survey (ETOE) with partial results. 
The annual results are averages of three-quarters (Q1, Q3 and Q4). For the United Kingdom 
(2003/04), data for Tables A to C are annual averages of quarterly estimates from the Annual 
Population Survey (APS); prior to 2004, they refer to the spring quarter (April-June) Labour 
Force Survey (LFS). Data for Tables G to K are annual averages of quarterly estimates from 
APS from 2016 onwards. 
• 
Change in the operational definition of employment: 
o 
Neat application of the criterion of “at least one hour worked in a gainful job” in the Chilean 
Nueva Encuesta Nacional de Empleo (NENE), a quarterly continuous survey, from 
April 2010 onward.

• 
Change in the operational definition of usual working time: 
o 
In Israel, the Labour Force Survey questionnaire was expanded and changed since 
January 2018. Workers absent from work are asked “how many hours they usually work”. 
This affects the number of workers reporting usual weekly hours worked in their main job 
prior and after 2018 notably Table G on the incidence and composition of part-time 
employment according to a common 30-hour threshold-based definition. 
• 
Change in the operational definition of unemployment regarding: 
o 
Active job-search methods: in particular a change from registration to contact with the public 
employment service: France (2002/03) and Spain (2000/01). 
o 
Duration of active job search: In Australia (2014/15), the duration of unemployment has 
been replaced by duration of job search. In Belgium (2010/11), the duration of job search 
has been changed from an unlimited duration to previous four weeks including the survey 
reference week. In Chile (2009/10), the duration of active job search has been shortened 
from last two months to previous four weeks including the survey reference week. 
o 
Availability to work criterion: In Sweden (2004/05), the work availability criterion changed 
from the reference week to two weeks from the reference week to be consistent with the 
operational definition in other EU countries. In Chile, the work availability criterion did not 
exist prior to 2010 in the Encuesta Nacional de Empleo (ENE) and was introduced in the 
Nueva Encuesta Nacional de Empleo (NENE) since April 2010. It has been fixed to 
two weeks from the end of the reference week. 
o 
Persons on lay off considered as employed instead of unemployed: Norway (2005/06). 
o 
Other minor changes: Australia (2000/01) and Poland (2003/04). 
• 
Changes in the questionnaire with impact on employment and unemployment estimates: 
Germany (2010/11): new questionnaire design ensures better coverage of small jobs. This led 
to a higher-than-normal annual employment increase. Impact on employment and 
unemployment statistics in New Zealand (2015/16) with the inclusion of army personnel. Spain 
(2004/05): impact on employment and unemployment and impact on unemployment estimates 
in Norway (2005/06) and Sweden (2004/05). 
• 
Change from seasonal to calendar quarters: Switzerland (2009/10) and the United Kingdom 
(2005/06). However, there is no break in series between 2005 and 2006 for the United Kingdom 
as calendar quarter based historical series are available since 1992. 
• 
Introduction of new EU harmonised questionnaire: Sweden (2004/05) and Türkiye (2003/04). 
• 
Change in lower age limit from 16 to 15 years: Iceland (2008/09), Norway (2005/06) and 
Sweden (2006/07). 
• 
Change in lower age limit from 15 to 16 years: Italy (2007/08). 
• 
Change in data collected in Denmark since the first quarter of 2017: the LFS response rate 
increased and resulted in a significant break in series between 2016 and 2017. 
• 
Inclusion of population controls based on latest census results in the estimation 
process: Mexico (2009/10) and Türkiye (2006/07). In Canada, LFS population control totals 
have been revised from January 2011 to December 2024. Similarly, in Portugal, Labour Force 
Survey weights were calibrated using the resident population estimates calculated from the final 
results of the 2021 Population Census. Back series were revised accordingly since 2011. 
• 
Other 
o 
In Norway, as of 2006 age is defined as years reached at the survey reference week, instead 
of completed years at the end of the year, as in previous years. 
o 
In Japan, data for Table I on temporary employees has a break in series between 2013 and 
2017.

OECD Employment Outlook 2025
Can We Get Through the Demographic Crunch?
Population ageing is one of the megatrends shaping the future of societies and labour markets. The old‑age 
dependency ratio – the ratio of individuals aged 65 and older to the working‑age population – is projected to reach 
unprecedented high levels in many OECD countries in the next 35 years. This edition of the OECD Employment Outlook 
discusses the enormous challenges this megatrend poses to current living standards, and social cohesion more 
generally. The consequences of an ageing workforce for productivity growth are also analysed. The main message 
of this edition is that without swift changes in policies and behaviours, GDP per capita growth will slow down 
significantly in most OECD countries. Mobilising untapped labour resources, including older workers but also women 
in many countries, will be key to offsetting this trend. This Outlook examines policies to address these demographic 
changes, with a focus on increasing employment of older workers while ensuring that they can thrive in the labour 
market. It shows that a successful strategy must be built around incentives, employability and opportunities. Policies 
to preserve and develop worker skills and job mobility will also be essential to maintaining productivity growth.
